    <td><p>With all the anticipation of Season 4 of Disney's Kim Possible, it will be inevitable that rumors and questions will arise. Such snippets of information, commonly called 'spoilers', are often rumors, fan fic scenarios, and most likely have no basis in fact.</p>
<p>We at KP Fan World are very concerned that inaccurate information will needlessly cause intense debate and consternation for fans of the show.</p>
<p>In order to 'set the record straight' regarding the upcoming season, the following page has been created. On it both Confirmed and Unconfirmed spoilers are listed.</p>
<p>Confirmed Spoilers have each been verified by KP Fan World staff members with KP Crew members including Bob Schooley, Mark McCorkle and Steve Loter via email, chat sessions or direct conversations. Unconfirmed Spoilers are submissions from users that are seeking verification. As the KP Crew is not obligated to confirm anything herein listed, Unconfirmed Spoilers may never be addressed. However, should an Unconfirmed Spoilers be verified, it will change to Confirmed status. And unless requested otherwise, should the KP Crew share Spoiler information with us, we would in turn share it with you on this page.</p>
<p>By clicking "I agree" you signify that you are aware that the following page contains spoilers and that the Unconfirmed Spoilers are not to be taken as factual.</p>
<p>By clicking "I agree" you acknowledge that you fully understand the purpose of this page and that you will not bear ill will toward this site or its operators for any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>By clicking "I agree" you understand that reasonable attempts to confirm spoilers have been made but that future circumstances may well prove them wrong. We do what we can, but there is always the possibility of changes occurring within the show up to the actual broadcasts.</p>
<p>Your name and email address is recoreded from your membership registration. Requiring users to be registered and logged in to submit spoilers better allows us to keep the spoilers list from becoming filled with inappropriate material which may be unsuitable for a family environment.</p>
