It also introduces Cyrus Bortel.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A black SUV drives through the desert.  It’s plant life and landscape indicates it is most likely Arizona.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The SUV drives past this cactus, stops, and reverses back to the cactus.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego uses a magnetic card and swipes it on the cactus.  A red light appears.  The cactus is only a disguise.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is driving.  Shego is in the passenger’s seat.   A large door raises up from the desert sand.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The SUV goes down the secret entrance.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A guard sits lazily while watching a monitor.

The guard thinks it a man by the name of Frank who is supposed to have his iced mocha.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Before the guard can react, Shego knocks him out by touching his forehead with a shot of plasma from her hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken appears at the door and congratulates Shego.  Shego tries to stop him from entering.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates he is in charge, and that he’ll enter if he wants to.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>An alarm goes off.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates she hasn’t shut down the alarm yet.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>One female and two male soldiers enter the room.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego jumps with plasma hands ready.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>She lands in the middle of the three and easily takes them out.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego stacks the soldiers.

It is a pocket watch.  Drakken complains about the time it is taking.  The time is 2:00.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego jumps forward and accuses Drakken of setting off the alarm.  Shego then suggests they steal whatever it is they have come to get and get out of there.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands obedience.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates she does not have to obey Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tells the audience that if his latest scheme works, obedience is what he will have.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/the_twin_factor/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets ready for bed by brushing her teeth.  She is also doing a facial.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is surprised by an air horn and a camera flash.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wearing pajamas.  First appearance of the Possible bathroom.  Tim has a digital camera.  Kim demands the camera.  Tim takes out the memory card, and throws Kim the camera.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim chases Tim.  Tim rushes into his room, and throws Jim the memory card.  Jim puts the card into his computer.  First appearance of Jim and Tim’s room.  It is decorated with a space theme including rockets, planets, and stars.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim indicates that Kim’s picture is now a screensaver for everybody.  Tim indicates they wrote an email program that sent it to everyone in Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t believe Jim and Tim have the technical know how to write such a program.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie calls Kim.  Bonnie has a bed with a head board in the shape of a heart.  There is also a glamour shot of herself on the wall.  Bonnie’s phone is not cordless.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie has a computer by her bed, and has received the screensaver.  She makes fun of Kim for needing zit cream.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates it is not zit cream; it’s moisturizer.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim and indicates that Drakken and Shego broke into a top secret facility.  Kim asks for a ride.  Wade indicates that the lab is sending their plane.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade then makes fun of Kim after receiving the screensaver too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim groans and turns Wade off.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The next morning, Kim sits down for breakfast.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s breakfast is ready.  It is two eggs, sunny side up, with a slice of bacon.  There are two forks and two knives by her plate.  The plate looks like a happy face.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is annoyed by how her breakfast looks.  It makes her feel like she is being treated as a kid.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates she made Kim’s breakfast.  Mr. Possible tells Kim she needs to “carb up” for the day.  Eggs and bacon are not carbs.  They are proteins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells her parents that she’s going to investigate the break in at the top secret lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Possible indicate Kim has to babysit the twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drops her bacon in horror at the thought of babysitting the twins.  Her plate now looks like a sad face.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates they have a spousal encounter today.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim forgot about the spousal encounter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates that he and Mrs. Possible will reconnect emotionally, and do some fly fishing.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible is not completely thrilled about fly fishing, but she’s willing to try it anyways for fun.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible gives Mrs. Possible a fishing hat with fishing hooks in the lapel.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she completely forgot about the spousal encounter.  Mrs. Possible reminds Kim that she made a commitment, and has to stand by it.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates Kim will have to take Jim and Tim.  Mr. Possible puts on hiking boots.  His boots don’t have laces.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries to get her mother’s support of her having to take Jim and Tim with her on a mission.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates that Jim and Tim would love to see a top secret base.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gives in, but complains about it.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is shocked to find her room is completely messed up.  She knows that Jim and Tim did it.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim storms back downstairs.  She stops when she sees her parents.  Apparently, she doesn’t want to give them the impression that anything is wrong.  Mr. Possible is wearing fishing waders.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible gives Kim some advise.  “Easy on the snacks.  Remember, candy is dandy.  But fruit helps you poop.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After her parents leave, Kim confronts Jim and Tim about how they messed her room up.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tim indicates they needed her tri-lithium power cell from her kimmunicator.  They took her kimmunicator apart too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim indicate they were working on a handheld silicon phase disrupter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes the silicon phase disrupter and calls Jim and Tim “Tweebs.”  First time Kim calls Jim and Tim this.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim thought Kim called him a dweeb.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets her battery back and throws the silicon phase disrupter back at Jim and Tim.  She explains that “tweeb” is “twin dweeb; dweeb squared.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim cleans her room while Ron tries to fix the kimmunicator.  Ron says, “We may be never able to talk to Wade again.”  This is a reference to the running gag in the series that Kim and Ron never see Wade except by school locker computer or kimmunicator.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus takes the kimmunicator to fix it.  Rufus crawls under it like a mechanic working on a car.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wonders why she can’t have normal brothers.  Ron indicates they’re relatively normal.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, “At least they don’t speak their own weirdo language.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim says, “Hickabickaboo!”  Tim says, “Hoosha!”  This indicates that Jim and Tim do have some weirdo language of their own.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t believe that a ten year old can build a silicon phase disrupter.  This indicates how old the twins are.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that Wade is ten years old too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Wade is a super genius who got through high school and college in eight months.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suggests that maybe the twins are taking it easy, just like he does.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus fixes the kimmunicator.  This is another indication of how technical Rufus is.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, and Rufus hear a car horn playing the popular folk song from Mexico, La Cucaracha.  It’s unheard of for a plane to have a car horn, much less for the horn to be heard before the plane.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The plane from the top secret lab is the same model that Jack Hench has.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The plane lands in the street in front of the Possible’s house.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks Jim and Tim if they need to take care of any business before going.  She is obviously referring to using the bathroom.  This is often a problem for young children on car trips.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron isn’t sure what kind of business Kim is talking about.  He asks if she means banking.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim uses air quotes to emphasize there won’t be any rest stops.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets confused about Kim talking about rest.  He believes the boys are old enough not to need naps.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus whispers in Ron’s ear what Kim is really talking about.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs back into the house to take care of business.  The Possible house is unlocked.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim roll their eyes the same way Kim does at Ron’s behavior.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim thanks the pilot for allowing her to bring the twins along.  The pilot’s name is Mr. Giminini.  Gemini is the astrological sign for “The Twins.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim annoy Ron by asking about the plane’s hose.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim get out of their chairs and seat belts to check out the plane’s hose.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pushes a button on her kimmunicator.  It is broken.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Giminini indicates he has a twin brother.  He indicates he turned out okay.  His twin brother will get out of jail in five years with good behavior.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A red light starts flashing on the console.  Ron is heard in the back scolding the twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The plane suddenly nosedives.  Mr. Geminini holds the joystick tight to get control back to no avail.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Geminini indicates that the pressure gauges are reading zero.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The twins apologize.  Kim is frustrated at the twins.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/the_twin_factor/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The plane spins around in circles.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim are back in their seatbelts.  Kim crawls on the ceiing to get to the back.  Jim, Tim, Ron, and Rufus wear oxygen masks.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus swings back and forth from the motion of the mask.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim indicates they just wanted to see what was in the hose.  They found out it was hydraulic fluid.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim jumps down and finds the hydraulic hose swinging out of control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries to catch the hose, but she can’t.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is hit and knocked backwards by the hose.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim makes a second attempt to catch the hoses, but misses.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim attaches her grappling hook to a pipe.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pulls back the grappling hook, launches herself forward, and catches the hoses.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim clamps the hoses together on her second attempt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The plane is back under control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Happy to be alive, Ron kisses Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates Rufus has really bad breath and asks him to stop eating blue cheese.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is annoyed at Ron’s remark.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Cyrus Bortel.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A male soldier and a female soldier drag Mr. Geminini away.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked what happened to the pilot, Kim points at the twins and claims overexposure to them.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim rush in to see the top secret lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron takes Kim by the arm, drags her to the side, and indicates the twins in a top secret lab could be a bigger threat than Drakken.  Kim agrees.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus investigates a safe with claw marks.  Kim, Ron, and Rufus know that Shego did this.  First indication that Shego’s plasma can cut through solid metal.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees the twins playing with Bortel’s machine.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is annoyed at the twins too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel grabs the boys and gets them off his machine.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel is about to reveal the name of his machine.  Jim tells him his machine is a silicon phase disrupter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel is amazed that Jim and Tim know what his machine is.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tim shows off their silicon phase disrupter that he was holding inside his shirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim become angry when Bortel doesn’t think their silicon phase disrupter is real.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel doesn’t think that a handheld silicon phase disrupter is possible.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim are the first to say, “Anything is possible for a Possible.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel indicates when he was young, he liked to pretend he was making rockets and blaster rays.  He ruffles Tim’s hair.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim indicate they do make rockets and blaster rays.  Bortel doesn’t believe this either.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel is annoyed by Jim and Tim making farting sounds under their armpits.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked by Kim, Bortel indicates that his latest project, the neural compliance chip, was in the safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim indicates that the neural compliance chip is a microcomputer that overrides the brain and the nervous system.  Tim indicates it’s for total mind control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t think Bortel would create such a device because it would be unethical.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel indicates he did make such a device.  But he never thought it was unethical.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus are worried about Drakken having the ability to take over minds and have control over them.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates it is a take over the world scheme.  Ron indicates that Drakken will make people listen to stories about his twisted childhood.  This is a subtle reference to Tick Tick Tick, when Ron and Kim heard Drakken complain that the reason he wanted to take over the world was because he was teased and taunted in gym class by other children.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken paces back and forth.  He tells Shego stories about his twisted childhood.  In this case, it is about how he created a ray in the fourth grade that would allow him to control rubber products.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego was not wearing the purple apron in the previous shot.  First time Shego wears a purple apron.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that after creating the ray to control rubber products, nobody could beat him at four square, tetherball, or dodge ball.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego has a compliance chip on her forehead.  She also has a tray with cookies and what appears to be milk.  The apron disappears again.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego shippers claim this episode has subtle hints at  indicating that Drakken is crushing on Shego.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken asks Shego if she wants to hear more tales from his childhood.  Under mind control, Shego answers “yes” to everything he suggests.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates he has to make more chips if he wants to rule the world.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken pulls a lever.  Some equipment can be heard powering up.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel indicates that a security officer already searched the lab.  Kim pulls something from her bag.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts on spectrometer sunglasses.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim activates the spectrometer sunglasses by touching it at the top of the right side.  It appears to be sensor that allows Kim to see in infrared.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel is impressed.  He asks where Kim got them.  Kim answers from a ten year old super genius.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bortel asks if Kim is referring to her brothers.  Kim indicates she is not.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Spectrometer sunglasses allow Kim to see footprints everywhere.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim zooms in by touching it on the left side at the top.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim finds a possible clue and picks it up with tweezers.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The spectrometer sunglasses also allows Wade to see and analyze the clue that Kim has.  Wade indicates the clue is a piece of a leaf.  Wade also indicates it is from the qualotoc fern.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates the qualotoc fern only grows at the foot of Taishu Falls in the Peruvian rainforest.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim makes a plan, and then begins wondering where the twins are.  An explosion is heard.  It seems they are responsible for blowing up Bortel’s silicon phase disrupter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus got hurt too.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/the_twin_factor/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, Jim, and Tim get to Peru by the same plane that brought them to the lab.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has her hair in a ponytail for the parachute jump.  Ron is not wearing a safety helmet.  Tim is strapped to Ron.  Jim is strapped to Kim.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked by Kim what they were doing, Jim and Tim indicate they were trying to fix Bortel’s silicon phase disrupter.  It wasn’t broken, it was lame.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks if it is time to pull the chutes open.  Tim indicates that freefalling is cool.  He grabs Ron’s wrists so he can’t pull the cords.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pulls Ron’s chute open, then opens her own.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, and the twins arrive at the foot of Taishu Falls.  But they don’t see a lair.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim points the kimmunicator at the falls.  After scanning it, Wade indicates there are huge energy readings coming from halfway up.  Kim assumes there is an entrace behind the falls.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders why the entrances are never just a door.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim plan: She’ll infiltrate Drakken’s lair and get the chip.  Ron has to babysit the twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron complains that his part of the assignment is the more dangerous.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim indicate they want to go with Kim.  They indicate they can be backup.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim shoots her grappling hook to the top of the falls.<br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells the twins not to touch anything.  Kim might be afraid of dangerous plants, or secret devices from Drakken’s lair.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim swings over to the other waterfall, and begins rock climbing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t spot the security camera.  It is painted the same color as the rock.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is on Drakken’s giant monitor.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s Peruvian lair is set up just like his main lair in Tick Tick Tick.  Under mind control, Shego is always cheerful.  Drakken asks for a micrometer.  Shego doesn’t move.  She may not know what a micrometer is.  Drakken asks for a nano weld resistor.  Shego hands him one that is on the table in front of her.  Drakken asks for a fork.  Shego has to walk to the back of the room to get one.  She also throws a few things out of her way first.  Drakken than asks for a dodo bird.  Shego walks back to the back of the room, throws a few more things, then comes back empty handed.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>While Shego is looking for a dodo bird, Drakken tells the audience that he is being silly because dodo birds are extinct.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken shows Shego his finished neural compliance chip.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego agrees with everything Drakken says.  This begins to annoy Drakken because she doesn’t show any true enthusiasm.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego points to the giant monitor with Kim and says, “Hoorah.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands to know why Shego didn’t point out Kim sooner.  Shego indicates it is because she was looking for a dodo bird.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken paces for a second, then has a plan.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim comes to a clearing on a rock and sees Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken puts his newest compliance chip on Kim’s forehead before she can do anything.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is now under Drakken’s control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim indicate they are bored.  Ron indicates that boring is good because it is safe.  This might be a reference to the Discworld book series by Terry Pratchett.  The main character, Rincewind, wishes for a life that is boring because it is safe and he doesn’t want to be a hero.<br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim want to go up and see what is taking Kim so long.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus taps into his mystical monkey power and uses the stick as a bo.  This doesn’t stop the twins though.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron stops the boys and indicates that Kim told them to stay put.  Tim argues that Kim isn’t here.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim answers that she is here.  Kim is dressed as Shego.  Ron asks her why she is dressed like Shego.  It seems that Drakken enjoys seeing women dressed up in Shego’s jumpsuit.  It also mean that Drakken has a jumpsuit to fit Kim’s size.  Shego’s jumpsuit is one of Kim’s alternative costumes in the PS2 game Kim Possible: What’s The Switch?<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/183.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim point to the compliance chip on Kim’s forehead.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/184.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim comes out of the shadows.  Ron, Jim, and Tim see that Kim is under mind control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/185.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim says, “Dr. Drakken will see you now.”  This is the same thing that nurses or receptionists often tell patients when the doctor is ready to see them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hands Rufus to Tim and indicates he is going to confront Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron taps his mystical monkey power to fight Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs Ron and flips him.  It’s been debated on message boards whether or not Ron would win in a fight against Kim if he tapped into his mystical monkey power.  While most agree that Ron could win, it’s been theorized that he is incapable of hurting Kim.  This scene is the strongest evidence for that.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/189.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim cheerfully indicates that Drakken has ordered her to capture Ron Stoppable.  Ron becomes cheerful himself as he indicates Drakken remembered his name.  In reality, Drakken probably forgot Ron’s name again, and Kim reminded him.  Another indication that Ron wants Drakken to remember his name.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/190.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim decide to do the “capture big sister sequence.”  They praise the fact they’re not going to get in trouble for it.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/191.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim grabs a vine and climbs the tree to a low hanging limb.  Tim slides under Kim’s feet.  Tim then throws the parachute pack up to Jim.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim throws the parachute pack over the limb and jumps down.  Kim is standing on the parachute.  It closes on her.  Tim grabs Jim’s feet and pulls him down capturing Kim in the parachute.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is impressed the twins have captured Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim tie the parachute lines around the tree.  Kim is now suspended in the air with the parachute.  They also use the phrase, “No big.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim, Tim, and Ron run away.  Kim immediately begins cutting the parachute with her laser pen.  It was last seen in Crush.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron, Jim, and Tim climb a tree to hide.  Ron has a harder time getting up to the tree limb.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus points out Kim.  Kim continues to repeat over and over again, “Must capture Ron Stoppable.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron complains that Kim would think of a plan if she were here and not under mind control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim suggest that Ron should allow himself to be captured by Kim because Drakken doesn’t know about them.  Jim and Tim indicate that they will follow, and Ron has to get the kimmunicator.  Ron thinks this is to call for help.  Jim and Tim indicates they need the battery to power their silicon phase disrupter.  This will knock out the neural compliance chip.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tim pulls a rope with a hook attached out of Ron’s pouch.  He ties it around the limb of the tree.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets freaked out of Jim and Tim finishing each other’s sentences.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is pushed out of the tree before he can even agree or disagree with the plan.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim unhooks Ron and indicates he is to be taken to Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim know everything is going according to their plan.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego is back to wearing the purple apron and still compliments Drakken on how smart he is and looking good in the light.  Drakken is getting fed up with all the compliments he is receiving.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim brings Ron into Drakken’s lair.  Ron now has his hands tied behind his back.  Kim now compliments Drakken for being smart and looking good in the light.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken puts his arm around Shego and indicates that Kim can give better compliments than she can.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus jumps from Ron’s pocket to get the kimmunicator that is lying on the table.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken says, “So Kim Possible---You’ve climbed down the waterfall and captured your very best friend.”  This is evidence to support the idea that Drakken forgot Ron’s name.  Drakken puts his hand on Ron’s shoulder and squeezes Ron and Kim closer to him.  Drakken indicates he like mind control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim show up at the waterfall entrance.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/211.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tells Kim to go secure the perimeter.  Kim points out Rufus and calls him “the hairless rodent.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/212.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken stops Rufus from getting any further with the kimmunicator.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus tries to hide the kimmunicator behind his back; even though it is much bigger than he is.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/214.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands the kimmunicator.  Rufus gives it to him.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/215.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demand Shego and Kim destroy Rufus.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/216.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus jumps.  Kim and Shego ram into each other.  Shego is now wearing purple oven mitts to match her apron.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/217.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus jumps down and runs.  Kim and Shego chase him.  Drakken notices Jim standing beside him.  Drakken has the kimmunicator in his belt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tim jumps on Drakken’s back.  Drakken think Tim is a clone.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim grabs the kimmunicator.  Jim, Tim, and Ron all run away.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego have Rufus cornered.  However, Drakken demands they get “the clones.”  Rufus wipes the sweat off of his forehead.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim tells Ron to stall Kim and Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/222.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron taps his mystical monkey power again and dodges both Kim and Shego.  Kim and Shego attack Ron, even though Drakken told them to attack the twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/223.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron moves so that Shego cuts the ropes behind his back.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs through a metal door that is opening.  It is most likely motion triggered.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/225.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes to two metal doors.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/226.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron chooses the door on the right.  They open by pushing the red button.  Ron is surprised to see he has found the lounge room for Drakken’s henchmen.  They are playing cards.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/227.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron does a jump kick and takes out the red button so the door won’t open.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/228.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door dents with something hitting it from the other side.  This may be a possible reference to the movie Aliens.  It is very unlikely that the henchmen are damaging the door themselves without the use of heavy objects.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/229.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron goes through the door on the left.  Shego and Kim show up before he can damage the red button.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/230.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Even though he only had a second or two, Ron has disappeared from Kim and Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/231.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim checks out the bottom left of the room while Shego checks out the top right.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/232.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes down the aisle.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/233.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sneaks behind her without her noticing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/234.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron finds an elevator.

Ron jumps onto a nearby platform.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/239.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron advises himself not to look down.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/240.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron falls through the soft metal cover because he wasn’t looking down to see where he was stepping.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/241.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron falls through a series of shafts.  This scene may have been inspired by Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.<br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/242.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is freaked out by Jim and Tim running circles around him.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/243.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron drops in from the ceiling and lands on Drakken’s table.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/244.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees Drakken and panics.  He backs up to the metal door.  The metal door opens revealing Kim and Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/245.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim demand everybody stop.  Drakken figures out that Jim and Tim are not clones, but ordinary twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/246.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim indicate they have a portable silicon phase disrupter.  Like Bortel, Drakken scoffs at the idea of a portable silicon phase disrupter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/247.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim activates the silicon phase disrupter.  Nothing happens.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/248.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells the twins to make sure the battery is in right.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/249.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Once the battery is in right, a large amount of energy emerges from the conduits of the silicon phase disrupter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/250.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The silicon phase disrupter sends out a beam that separates in two.  It hits Kim and Shego’s neural compliance chip.  The neural compliance chips are vaporized.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/251.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego are back to normal.  Shego compliments Kim on her jumpsuit.  Kim compliments Shego on the apron.  Shego rips the apron off.  The oven mitts that Shego is wearing disappear between this shot and the next.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/252.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates the chip made her obey every command.  She also knew what was happening the entire time.  Shego screams at him for making her listen to stories about his childhood, and making her do silly things like fetching extinct dodo birds.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/253.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego swipes at Drakken.  Drakken runs away.  Shego chases Drakken, still yelling at him.  She indicates that listening to Drakken is boring.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/254.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks if they’re going after Drakken and Shego.  Kim indicates that whatever Shego does to Drakken will be a lot worse than anything they do to him.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/255.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, “I’m sure Jim and Tim could think of something cruel and ususual.”  This is a reference to the Eight Admendment to the United States Constitution, which states that people can’t be tortured, or given cruel and unusual punishment by the government.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/256.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim compliments Jim and Tim on their help with the mission.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/257.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim are disgusted when Kim hugs them.  Tim asks Kim if she is feeling okay.  There has been some debate as to why Kim didn’t compliment Ron for handling her and Shego.  This goes back to the idea that Kim can’t handle Ron when he is better than her at something.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/258.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests they all leave.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/259.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Possible took the minivan on the spousal encounter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/260.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It has been theorized on message boards that this shot is a glimpse at the future Stoppable family.  Many believe that Kim and Ron will have twins of their own.  Kim is reading a magazine.  Everyone else is asleep.  Rufus is asleep in Ron’s lap.  Jim and Tim share a small blanket.  Ron has an empty plate and glass at his feet.  This was the same plate and glass that Shego had earlier in the episode that had the cookies.  Everyone has a pillow on their back.<br/><br/> <img src="images/the_twin_factor/261.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim snores a bit and drools while he sleeps.  Tim hogs the blanket.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/262.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible comes and announces that their marriage is stronger than ever.  They also caught some trout.  Mrs. Possible carries three trout wrapped in newspaper.  Mrs. Possible compliments Kim on taking care of the twins.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/263.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim spreads out the blanket and indicates the twins look innocent when they sleep.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/264.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is shocked to hear that she was once high spirited and energetic like the twins.  Mr. Possible indicats that they couldn’t get a babysitter to handle her after a while.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/265.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible sees Jim and Tim with neural complaince chips on their foreheads.  Mrs. Possible asks what they are.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/266.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim activates the silicon phase disrupter.  There is no beam this time.  Jim and Tim may have set the power down.  The neural compliance chips pop off rather than get disintegrated.  This also indicates that the battery for the kimmunicator is still in the silicon phase disrupter.  Kim most likely did this to have the rest of the night off instead of hearing anything from Wade.  It is unknown where Kim got neural compliance chips since Drakken only made two, and they were completely destroyed.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/267.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim wake up.  They immediately begin running around.  Jim chases Tim with the pillow they were sleeping on.  This wakes Ron up too.  The sound of stuff breaking is heard in the background.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_twin_factor/268.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she now understands her brothers more now.  She also indicates the best thing to get them to settle down is with mind control.  <br/><br/>
