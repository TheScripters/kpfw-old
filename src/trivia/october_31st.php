Shego practically jumps in Kim's arms.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ball hit's the ceiling.  The roof begins to crack and crumble.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First indication that Drakken is ticklish.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus steals the centurion project from Drakken.  Drakken calls Rufus, ''Hairless vermin.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus throws the centurion project onto Kim's wrist.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego grabs Kim's arm.

<img src="images/october_31st/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Possible home is decorated for Halloween.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The centurion project is so tight on Kim's wrist, she can barely put a fingertip in to pull it off.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls.  He indicates that the top secret lab in charge of the centurion project is closed for the weekend.  This indicates that this episode takes place on a Friday or Saturday.  He also indicates their computers are hacker proof so he can't find out what the centurion project is or does.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique calls.  First time we see Monique's room.  Monique indicates she can have a party.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The party is tonight on Halloween.  It's a costume party.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time Kim throws herself onto her bed when distressed.  Kim tells Monique she won't be there for her party.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, and Monique go to Bueno Nacho.  Kim explains that Ron loves Halloween.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron explains that going to Monique's party would interfere with TorT action.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>TorT stands for trick or treat.  Monique finishes the rhyme: ''Smell my feet.  Give me something good to eat.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique was joking.  Ron indicates he does, ''Smell my feet.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reaches into the wrong pocket and pulls out Rufus.  This annoys Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reaches into the other pocket and pulls out his plan for the Halloween costume.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A close up of Ron's Halloween joint costume.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique suggests to Kim taking the part with the horn.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim comments that they might be too old for treak or treating.  Kim indicates last year, some kid called her, ''Ma'am.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron assures Kim that she commands respect.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim reminds Ron that she was dressed as a clown.  Ron reminds Kim she was actually a hobo.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique mentions that Halloween is a Ron/Kim tradition.  This is the first traditional Kim/Ron thing we see being done in the series.  Other traditions will in later episodes will  be in A Very Possible Christmas and Day Of The Snowmen.  Kim suggests coming to her place for the party after trick or treating.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that he and Kim don't stop trick or treating.  They hit Middleton, Lowerton, and Upperton.  First mention of Lowerton and Upperton.  Ron also indicates that it dates back to the beginning of their friendship.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that she and Ron have been friends since preschool.  First mention of how far back the Kim/Ron friendship goes.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A flashback to the first Halloween.  Kim dressed as a cowboy.  Ron dressed as a ballerina.  First time we see Kim and Ron as little kids.  First indication that Kim had freckles as a little kid.  First indication that Ron was always a natural dancer.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time we see Drakken's lair as a nice sunny day.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken talks to Killigan on a cordless phone.  Drakken refuses to pay Killigan for stealing the centurion project since Kim has it.  Killigan screams so loud, Drakken has to hold the phone away.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan is so angry, he bends a golf club.  Killigan leans on a trophy.  This indicates that at one time, Killigan was a really good golfer.  Killigan calls Drakken, ''A criminal.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken reminds Killigan that he tries to take over the world.  That really does make him a criminal.  Drakken cleans his ears out while talking.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan tells Drakken that if he gets the centurion project back, he'll sell it to someone else.  This prompts Drakken to want to get it before Killigan does.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken yells for Shego.  Shego reminds Drakken to use his ''indoor voice.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego has a cassette recording of Wade asking the top secret lab in charge of the centurion project to call back.  It is unlikely that Shego has Wade's place bugged with a hidden microphone.  She most likely found a way to bug the top secret lab.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After hearing that the centurion project is stuck on Kim's wrist, Drakken decides to take action.  Drakken's smile might have been inspired by the Joker from Batman.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible goggles appear to work both as a magnifyer, and a microscope.  Mr. Possible indicates the centurion project will be stuck on her arm till Monday.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates the bracelet appears to be a super strong metal alloy.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim suggest Kim get her arm cut off, then reattaching it.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This idea worries Kim that they might do it.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible brings in Mr. Cadaver.  He's a latex replica used by medical students.  A large cloth covers his private areas.  Mr. Cadaver is most likely anatomically correct.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim are anxious to use Mr. Cadaver.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates that Jim and Tim are helping with ''scare for care haunted house.''  It's a charity event held at the hospital.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is surprised that Jim and Tim aren't trick or treating.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim feel like they're too old to trick or treat.  Jim indicates they're both ten years old.  This only depresses Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique calls again.  She indicates that Josh Mankey has a garage band, and they'll be playing at her party.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls.  His costume was mostly likely inspired by Batman.  Wade indicates he doesn't leave his room.  He trick or treats online.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken flies over Middleton in his flying car, listening for Kim.  Wade tells Kim that he left a message at the lab center.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken has headphone on, but Shego can still the conversation.  Drakken must have the antenna plugged into the radio or other speaker.  Drakken's headphones may be the special kind that filters out background noise.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken complains that the sound amplifier doesn't work when he's roaming.  This is a reference to cell phone use.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Duff Killigan is also over Middleton in his blimp.  He complains that his sound amplifier doesn't work when he's roaming.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim talks to Monique and Ron at the same time.  Monique confirms that Josh will be at the party.  Ron reminds Kim that they're falling behind schedule.  First appearance of Ron's room.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim lies to Ron and tells him that her mother is making her help at the haunted house.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken hears this and thinks he'll find Kim at the haunted house.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The centurion project begins growing on Kim's wrist.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sounds like he's about to cry on the other side of the line.  This doesn't help Kim feel better about letting Ron down.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Duff Killigan listens to the other part of the conversation.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible is dressed as a witch.  She overheard Kim tell Ron that she was coming with them to help at the haunted house.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates that Jim and Tim had hopes of drenching Kim in fake blood.  At least she hopes it's fake blood.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim now lies to her mom and tells her that she'll be with Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The centurion project grows some more.  Mrs. Possible doesn't notice the change.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan hears Mrs. Possible say, ''Have fun trick or treating.''  Killigan wonders if Kim is too old for trick or treating.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells Monique she isn't sure why she lied.  Only that she must have panicked.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After hanging up, Kim notices the centurion project has gotten bigger.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/october_31st/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade does a scan and sees that the centurion project is cutting edge nanotechnology.  The cybertonic circuitry is controlled by biometric parameters.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade answers another line hoping that it's the lab.  Instead it's Wade's friend Eugene.  Since Eugene is wearing a mask, we don't know what he looks like.  Eugene says, ''Greetings, hacker man.''  We don't know if Wade is dressed up as a fictional super hero named Hacker Man, or if the greeting is just a compliment of Wade's computer skills.  Eugene's room in the background was later used for Cousin Larry's room in Monkey Fist Strikes.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates he knew who it was because he crossed referenced the ISP address.  He also put the candy credits in his mailbox.  This shows how Wade does trick or treating online.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells Wade she wants the centurion project off before she goes to Monique's party.  This surprises Wade, since Kim usually goes with Ron trick or treating.  This also indicates that Wade must have known Kim and Ron for at least one year.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible says, ''Have fun with Ronald.''  Kim replies, ''I will.''  The centurion project grow some more.  Wade figures out that the centurion project grows whenever Kim lies.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that the centurion project is some kind of armor, and that the biometric parameters are related to stress.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn't think so.  She reminds Wade she was fighting Drakken, Shego, and Killigan while wearing the bracelet and nothing happened.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates Kim must be more stressed about lying than she is fighting.  He then calls Kim, ''Pinocchio.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron in the bottom half of the joint costume.  Ron suddenly shows up.  He indicates he saw Kim's parents leave and hopes they're back on for trick or treating.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim lies to Ron again, saying she'll meet her parents later.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The centurion project grows again.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn't notice that Kim hand, arm, and upper body is covered in metal armor.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to give the top half of the joint costume to Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes the costume, and closes the door on Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim seems to get an angry or disappointing vibe from the costume.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim picks up the ringing telephone, and crushes it in her hand.  It still works though.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique indicates that Josh is at her party.  Kim throws down the telephone; she doesn't hang it up.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Middleton Medical Center.  It is a clear night, but thunder is heard.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The haunted house is next door to the medical center.  The thunder is a sound effect from the haunted house.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br>Mrs. Possible accepts tickets.  Mr. Possible is dressed as a vampire and entices guests with a European accent similar to Bela Lugosi, who made Count Dracula famous.  He even dyes his hair all black.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Patrons for the scare for care haunted house aren't dressed for Halloween.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego hide behind the corner.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When told to blend in, Shego puts on her Team Go mask to fit in with Halloween.  Drakken thinks Shego is only trying to annoy him.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Monique's house.  The young children appear later in this episode with Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Josh sets up his stage for the band.  His band are all dressed as pirates.  It's not known whether or not Josh plays an instrument.  He's wearing a hook over his hand.<br/><br/> <img src="images/october_31st/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim arrives dressed as a princess.  Monique is dressed as a cowgirl.  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes up to Josh and tries to speak ''Pirate.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim still gets nervous talking to Josh.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Josh notices Kim's hand.  Kim tells him that she is dressed as ''The Princessinator.''  This is a play on the movie, ''The Terminator.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Josh says, ''I heard your folks are doing a scare for care haunted house.''  This seems to indicate that Josh didn't know that Kim's parents were involved in the event.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Josh indicates he goes to the scare for care haunted house every year.  He also indicates it's for a good <br/>cause, and a good time.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Josh invites Kim to the haunted house.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn't want to tell Josh that she lied to her parents about where she would be.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The centurion project grows and covers Kim's other hand.  Josh notices.<br/><img src="images/october_31st/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes to Monique and asks to hide for a while in the bathroom.  Thinking that Kim wants to make out with Josh, she suggests the closet instead.   Kim wants the bathroom.  Monique points the way.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron annoys the kids with the trick or treat line, ''Smell my feet.  Give me something good to eat.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time we hear this background character talk.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The young trick or treater asks Ron not to say, ''Smell my feet.''  <br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, ''Hey!  Unicorn came to play!''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The young trick or treater says, ''You're not a unicorn!  You're just a horse's---.  He doesn't finish the line.  This is a play on the derogatory phrase, ''You're just a horse's rear end.''<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The young trick or treater was interrupted by Duff Killigan.  The youngster make fun of Duff for dressing like a girl and wearing a skirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan ignores the kids as they walk off.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sympathizes with Duff Killigan, and reminds him that kids can be cruel.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan's remembers Ron and calls him, ''Mr. Stoppable.''  Killigan demands to know where the centurion project is.  Ron tells him that it's still stuck on Kim's wrist.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Killigan demands to know where Kim is.  Ron tells Killigan that she is not with him.  Killigan indicates that Kim told her parents that she was going to be with Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/october_31st/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The conversation is interrupted when the background character comes out and gives candy to Killigan.  He thinks he's dressed for Halloween too, and advises the girl costume works better without the beard.
