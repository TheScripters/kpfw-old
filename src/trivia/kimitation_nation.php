It is actually more chemicals than anything else.<br/><br/><img src="images/kimitation_nation/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assumes that Drakken is involved.

This confirms that Shego is indeed staying at the Billionaire's Club.  However, the land backgrounds are different.  Shego is most likely having fun on the backside of the island, which explains the difference.  This also confirms that Shego is a billionaire; in which the prime requisite for staying at the Billionaire's Club is to be a billionaire.<br/><br/><img src="images/kimitation_nation/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/kimitation_nation/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego is having fun water skiing with the hunky waiter.<br/><br/><img src="images/kimitation_nation/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is most likely daydreaming of Shego.

Supporters of a Drakken/Shego relationship says it's because of a deep rooted love for each other, much like the Kim/Ron relationship.
