<br>
<p>Show notes: This episode introduces Josh Mankey. Also many KP fans consider this the first episode, since it's production number is 101, and was the first episode to premier. This is really the first episode to show the first hints of shippiness between Kim and Ron.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>MHS sign</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First indication that Ron keeps a messy locker.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First indication that Ron smells of overripe fruit, as indicated in the later episode Animal Attraction, in which Ron finds out he is a pink sloth.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/4.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Some of the things Ron has in his locker: Books, folders, empty cans, pencils, a soccer ball, a bowling ball, and an umbrella.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus crawls out of Ron's pocket, goes up his shirt, and then goes back into Ron's pocket again.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/6.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim wonders why Ron never gets a normal pet; something not naked. We later find out in A Sitch In Time that Ron's father has severe allergies to animal hair.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/7.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron's motto: Never be normal!</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/8.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's reaction to seeing Josh Mankey.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/9.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim suddenly ignores Ron. Ron calls Kim, ''Kim Possible,'' saying the word Possible in French. Nicole Sullivan sometimes did this with the reoccurring character Antonia on Mad TV when she said, ''It is possible.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/10.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/crush_trivia/11.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Josh Mankey's first appearance. As an artist, Josh most likely designed the posters for the school dance himself.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/12.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron announces Josh's name, as though he is jealous that Kim is crushing on Josh. Rufus doesn't like Mankey either.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/13.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we hear the phrase, ''Amp down.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/14.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/crush_trivia/15.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim goes over to talk to Josh, but finds herself too nervous to say anything.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/16.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Josh saw Kim on the news last week, and that she saved an ambassador. This is a reference to Number One, when Kim tells Bonnie she was in Abu Dhabi saving an ambassador. Josh then walks off.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/17.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim wants to ask Josh to the dance.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/18.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron indicates that Kim and Ron have always gone to the dances together. This also indicates that Kim and Ron have been unofficially dating for some time now.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/19.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim doesn't want to go to this dance as friends. She wants a real date.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/20.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Kim puts her hand on Ron's shoulder.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/21.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron turns away from Kim, too shy to ask her for a real date. First time Ron fails to pick up Kim's signals that she's interested in him.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/22.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade calls Kim on the kimmunicator, just to tell her to meet him at her locker.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/23.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim opens her locker by turning the knob four times to the right, then three times to the left.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/24.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time the wanted pictures of Drakken and Shego are on Kim's locker door. The picture of Drakken is a police mug shot. The picture of Shego appears to have come from a newspaper or magazine. Wade prints out a number of hits from Kim's website from people who want her help.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/25.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron reads a hit from Mrs. Guiltmore, who needs someone to help her feed her cats for a week. Mrs. Guiltmore has eight cats and only one litter box.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/26.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Another hit is from Tokyo. First indication that Ron is lousy at geography. Ron thinks that Tokyo is in France.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/27.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken is in Tokyo. Drakken does have some athletic ability, as he is shown here swinging on a rope with only one hand.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/28.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First indication that Ron is upset that Drakken doesn't know Ron's name.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/29.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim gets to this mission by private commercial jet.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/30.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Rufus wearing stylish sunglasses. The cocktail drinks are obviously non-alcoholic.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/31.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Britina. Her name comes from a combination of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Britina is reading her own magazine. Britina indicates that Kim saved her Chicago show from a backstage fire.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/32.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Britina and Kim talk about how fearless she is. Ron reminds Kim of the time she fought a shark with her bare hands. This is a reference to Tick Tick Tick.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/33.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's only fear is Josh Mankey.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/34.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron asks Britina to the dance, and is quickly rejected.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/35.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim became jealous when Ron asked Britina out.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/36.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Yoshiko and Nakasumi-san. Yoshiko indicates that she is Nakasumi-san's translator.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/37.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron slicks his hair back before trying to ask Yoshiko to the dance.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/38.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim became jealous when Ron asked Yoshiko to the dance too.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/39.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Yoshiko and Nakasumi-san speak to each other only through whispering.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/40.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Yoshiko says that Nakasumi-san can't go to the dance, obviously unnerving Ron.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/41.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Yoshiko indicates that someone took over the factory. There are two hostages inside. It only needs two because it is the most automated factory in the world. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/42.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>One of the few times that Kim actually uses her belt for something.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/43.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Only time Ron uses the grappling gun.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/44.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Ron loses his pants.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/45.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron losing his pants doesn't even bother Kim, it annoys her. This indicates that Ron must have lost his pants many times before.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/46.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After losing his shirt, Ron never uses the grappling gun again.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/47.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron get into the factory by infiltrating a skylight. Kim cuts the window by using her laser pen.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/48.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>One of the few changes that Disney demanded was in this scene. It was originally supposed to be a car factory. It was changed to a video game factory. Ron indicates that the factory makes the Z-board, the fastest graphic system on the market. It won't hit the U.S. until Christmas. First indication that Kim does not like video games.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/49.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron says, ''Drakken's gonna steal Christmas.'' A reference to the Dr. Seuss book, ''How The Grinch Stole Christmas.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/50.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron argue on whether Drakken wants to take over the world, or save Christmas. First appearance of the Z-boy mascot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/51.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron scolds Kim for checking for blemishes during a hostage situation. Kim uses her compact to see the hostages. Then she checks for blemishes.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/52.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim gives Ron the kimmunicator. Her plan: Ron has to plug the kimmunicator into the video and be the distraction. Ron protests being the distraction.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/53.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Monitors throughout the plant loop a video of the Z-boy mascot saying, ''Konnichiwa!'' This annoys Drakken, who outbursts the comment cartoons make his eyes itch. Konnichiwa means hello in Japanese. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/54.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken asks the hostages if the video can be turned off. It can't. The hostages understand, indicating that they speak some English.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/55.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken takes his frustration out on his henchmen.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/56.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego sneaks up on Drakken and frightens him. First indication that Shego has some stealth ability.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/57.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron takes over the video monitors and broadcasts ''naked mole rat TV.'' </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/59.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken seems to remember Ron's voice, but doesn't remember his name. Shego calls Ron, ''Kim Possible's dopey sidekick.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/60.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim frees the hostages by cutting the ropes with her laser pen.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/61.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken finds out where Ron is by following the video wire.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/62.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron is captured when is pinned by a lifting truck. There was no driver indicating that it was revved up to a high rate of speed, pointed at the right direction, then let go.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/63.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego's mouth disappears for a second in this scene. A minor mistake.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/64.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/crush_trivia/65.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken pushes a red button on the remote control, starting his plan to steal the video game factory. Large drills come down through the ceiling. They attach themselves to the factory. The henchmen secure chains around other parts of the factory. One black helicopter hoists it away through the ceiling, breaking it away from it's foundation.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/66.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim most likely didn't pursue Drakken, because there was no way for Ron to assist her.</p>





<a name="act2"></a>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/67.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The Possible family is eating cereal for breakfast. The story of Kim rescuing the hostages is in the morning paper. Mr. Possible knows the name Dr. Drakken, but doesn't know that it is his old college buddy Drew Lipski as we later find out in Attack Of The Killer Bebes.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/68.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim mentions wanting to take Josh to the dance. Mr. Possible mentions that it is usually Ron who takes Kim to school functions. This indicates that Mr. Possible trusts Ron more than any other boy. Mr. Possible calls Ron by his full first name, ''Ronald'' throughout the series.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/69.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim calls Ron, ''a friend'' while Josh is ''a hottie.'' This unnerves Mr. Possible, which is the first indication that talking about boys makes him uneasy.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/70.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken's picture is in the paper.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/71.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mrs. Possible helps Kim with her boyfriend trouble.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/72.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Jim and Tim make fun of her.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/192.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates she likes Josh because he's cool, smart, really talented, and kind of quiet.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/73.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Jim and Tim advise Kim to send an anonymous e-mail and route it through Sweden so it can't be traced. First indication that Jim and Tim have high computer skills.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/74.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Jim and Tim's principle has been getting anonymous e-mails from Sweden. Oddly, Jim and Tim don't get in trouble for doing this.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/75.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mrs. Possible advises Kim, ''Big breath, then take the plunge.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/76.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>MHS sign</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim intends to ask Josh to the dance before the day is out. Ron isn't sure who he'll ask.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/78.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Some of the background students run back and forth several times in this scene.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/79.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron stalks the nameless girl in blue, the most popular background character in the show. First time we see the MHS library.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/191.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>She might have been inspired by Kim's original character design.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/80.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see the school cafeteria.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/81.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Josh walks by and says something but we can't hear it A minor mistake.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/82.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First indication that Josh is an artist.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/83.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie knows that Kim is crushing on Josh.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/84.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Bonnie mentions the food chain.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/85.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron shows up during cheer practice announcing that contrary to what the whole school thinks, he and Kim are not dating. Ron asks the cheerleaders for a date.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/89.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tries to help Kim get a date with Josh.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/86.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Ron announces that he's a ''bon diggity dancah.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/87.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Jessica, Liz, and Tara begin giggling. We don't know if it's because they think Ron is cute, or just funny.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/88.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus hides in Kim's backpack</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/90.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim wants to practice a move called, ''dog house pyramid.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/91.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see the mad dog pyramid fall and the cheerleaders are all piled on top of each other. This occurs after Ron distracts Kim with the kimmunicator.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/92.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron get to this mission by snow cat.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/93.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron wraps Rufus up with a scarf while reminding him that he was told to bring a jacket.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/94.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>When Kim asks for the research on Drakken, Ron gives her the research he has on Josh instead.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/95.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tells Kim that Josh's middle name is Wendell. He made it up to make Josh sound more unappealing.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/96.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Getting information he got from school gossip, Josh has turned down dance offers from Courtney Loup,</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/97.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Maria Rodriguez,</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/98.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Natasha Putin,</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/99.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Julia Roberts, later known as Amelia.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/100.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>And Bonnie. Ron didn't have a picture of Bonnie, so he drew one.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/101.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron asked the girls mentioned above to the dance. He was turned down.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/102.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Heinrich.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/103.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Heinrich reminds Kim that she saved his village from an avalanche last year. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/104.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron asks Heinrich if he has any daughters who would like to go to the dance with him. Heinrich replies, ''Nein!'' which means no in Nacospeak. This mission most likely takes place in either Nacospeaky or Austria.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/105.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that Ron started the avalanche. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/106.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim leaves Ron behind. Ron still can't do a snowboard very well.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/107.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Kim's electronic infrared binoculars.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/108.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade hacked into Drakken's security, but couldn't shut down the sensor beams. But he can enhance a frequency so that they can be seen.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/109.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The binoculars can also be used as a kimmunicator. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade either prays or meditates for a second before tackling Drakken's computer system.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/111.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade can type with each hand on two different keyboards with his eyes closed.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/112.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Laser sensor beams appear thanks to Wade's hacking job.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/113.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron doesn't realize he's in trouble when his snowboard goes backwards.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/114.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim catches Ron and they both go down the hill. She lets him go a few seconds later.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/115.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's snowboarding skill prevents her from hitting the laser beams.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/116.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron misses the beams thanks to The Ron Factor.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/117.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus hit's the laser beam.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/118.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Large mechanical devices come out of the snow.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/119.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>They have cameras on them which positively identify Kim and Ron.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/120.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>They then connect several mechanical walls together trapping Kim and Ron.</p>








<a name="act3"></a>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/121.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that she has never been captures that fast. She also equates the embarrassment of being captured is as bad as cheerleading practice that afternoon. Kim blames Ron, even though it was Rufus who set off the laser sensor.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/122.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Despite being captured, Ron tries to look on the bright side. He insists that at least they're now in Drakken's lair.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/123.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego shows up on the platform, ready for a fight.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/124.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Anxious to give her one, Kim jumps on the henchmen and makes it up to the platform where Shego is.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/125.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The henchmen advance ready to attack Ron.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/126.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/crush_trivia/127.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>One of the few things we see Kim pull out of her belt: Kissy girl lip gloss.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/128.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The lip gloss is actually knock out gas. It puts all the henchmen out in seconds.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/129.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The knock out gas is made from Wade's father dirty socks. First appearance of Wade's mother.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/130.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron throws the knock out gas to Kim, who uses it on Shego.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/131.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken shows up. He calls Kim, ''My teenage foe.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/132.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron still thinks Drakken wants to steal Christmas.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/133.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After being corrected by Drakken, Kim reminds Ron that she was right about Drakken's plan.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/134.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The automated factory becomes a giant robot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/135.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The robot is strong enough to rip a tank in half.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/136.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It can also shoot lasers.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/137.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim remains calm, even against her toughest challenge yet. The robot shakes the ground with each step it takes.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/138.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade tells Kim that Nakasumi-san put in an override module after looking at the blueprints for the robot factory.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/139.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron were almost crushed when Drakken lifts a heavy crate and tries to throw it down on top of them. They were warned to get out of the way when the video Z-boy mascot said, ''Konnichiwa!''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/140.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The arms and upper body movement of the robot are controlled by the two levers on the console. An electronic telescope helps target the lasers from the robot's hands.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/141.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken whines that if Kim were on the debate team instead of a cheerleader, he would have rid of her already.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/142.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>irst time Ron supports Kim and promotes the idea that she can do anything.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/143.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After hearing that, Drakken tries to blast Ron away.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/144.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron reminds Drakken that he's only the distraction.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/145.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>One of the more unusual items from the Kim Possible toy line was a Kim and Ron with magnets on their hands, similar to this scene.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/146.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A video camera comes out of the back. Kim destroys it with a punch.</p>

<p>Drakken tries to get Kim off the back of the robot. He reveals the override module instead.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/149.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A computer interface comes out of the bottom of the kimmunicator. Kim hooks Wade up to the giant robot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/150.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade gets in, but needs the password. Wade tries Nakasumi, but it doesn't work.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/151.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The Z-boy mascot mouths the word, ''Access Denied.''</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/152.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tries his special attack, ''Flying kick now!'' </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/153.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It doesn't work. Ron is captured and hung upside down.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/154.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus falls out of Ron's pocket.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/155.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim saves him. Unfortunately, she reveals her secure location to Drakken.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/156.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's grappling hook is purple in this scene. Usually, it's red.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/157.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Having rescued Rufus, Kim puts him in her pocket.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/158.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Seeing the laser charge up causes Kim to freeze in fear. Drakken tells Kim she should have stuck to babysitting. This indicates that Kim used to baby sit at one time instead of saving the world on a regular basis.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/159.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade tries Z-boy but that doesn't work either. Then the video monitor says, ''Konnichiwa!'' Wade realizes that the password is konnichiwa.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/160.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The laser powers down, Wade comes on the monitor, and the robot salutes. Wade is in control of the giant robot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/161.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken is quickly captured.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/162.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego regains consciousness before the henchmen and throws an electrical pole arm at the kimmunicator. It dislodges from the robot. Wade loses control of it.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/163.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Drakken fight girly style with silly little slaps.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/164.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Shego take their fight inside the robot console. It pushes the levers around.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/165.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The robot arms fling wildly out of control.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/166.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After twirling so fast, Ron feels like he going to hurl. Ron has a weak stomach throughout the series.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/167.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim kicks Shego into two levers. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/168.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The levers release Drakken and Ron. Ron falls to the ground. Drakken grabs the side of the robot. Following cartoon physics, Drakken hovers in mid air for a second before he manages to get to the robot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/169.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego pulls a lever that tilts the robot. Kim loses her balance and falls out of the cockpit.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/170.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim shoots the grappling hook and wraps the wire around the robot's legs, causing it to fall. This part is a reference to the AT-AT walker scene in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/171.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Unfortunately, it's going to fall on top of Ron.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/172.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/crush_trivia/173.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim pushes a button on her glove. It activates rocket skates. First appearance of Kim's rocket skates. Unlike most rollerblades, Kim's skates have only two wheels instead of four.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/174.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim grabs Ron and they marginally miss getting crushed by the falling robot.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/175.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken and Shego managed to get out of the falling robot. But what can they do now?</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/176.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron senses that Kim is upset about something. He indicates that Drakken is in jail, and that Christmas was saved. Kim reminds Ron again that Drakken did not want to steal Christmas. She also indicates that facing Drakken was nothing compared to the fear she has of asking Josh Mankey to the dance.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/177.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tries to encourage Kim to ask Josh out.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/178.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade calls Kim and tells her that Josh left third period and is heading their way. Wade must have found out about Kim's crush on Josh either by reading her diary, or Ron told him. Ron and Wade may have conspired to get Josh out of class early (the halls are lacking other students going to class) so that Kim could ask him out. On the other hand, Josh might be setting up decorations for the dance.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/179.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade finds Josh by triangulating his position on the G.P.S. satellite. Wade indicates that Josh just passed the gym. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/180.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim grabs Ron and hides in the janitor's closet.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/181.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim feels that she can't ask Josh out. </p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/182.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>This scene is a reference to Aliens.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/183.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron encourages Kim to ask Josh out by being her biggest supporter.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/184.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim bursts out of the closet, and nervously apologizes for tearing down the banner. Josh said it was kinds weak anyways.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/185.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Unlike Ron, Josh actually picked up Kim's signals that she was interested in him. Kim finally asks Josh out. Josh tells her he'll pick her up at seven. We later see in Blush that Josh has his own car.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/186.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron announces he needs a ride too. Kim slams the door on him. This keeps Ron away from her and Josh. This also keeps Ron from getting any last minute dates. Ron continues to ask for a ride, and suggests picking him up at 7:15. Then he indicates that his mom will be hemming his pants, then asks to be picked up at 7:30.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/187.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The original song playing here was later replaced with Angela Michael's I'm Ready. It is available on the KP soundtrack. Fans have been desperate to find out what the original song was.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/188.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie couldn't get a date. This puts her lower on the food chain than Kim. For some reason, Crystal and Bonnie show up to the dance in their cheerleader uniforms.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/189.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The kimmunicator beeps, but Kim promptly turns it off. Wade most likely was trying to reach Kim for another mission. However, Wade might have been trying to get Kim to release Ron from the closet. In any case, Kim refuses to be bothered while she is having a good time.</p>
<img src="images/crush_trivia/190.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It's unknown how long Ron was trapped in the closet. </p>
