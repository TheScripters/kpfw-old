Show Notes: This episode introduces Monique.  It emphasizes Ron's love for wrestling, as well as his need to have Kim as his friend.  This is the only episode where Kim and Ron meet Steel Toe and Pain King in person.  Otherwise, they're only seen on the television.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The episode starts with Kim and Ron being chased down a dark ally by men shouting, ''Pain!''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron try to elude the men by going down an even darker ally.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is clumsy, but still has high agility.  He crashes into the trash can, does a flip, land on his feet, and continues running.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron duck behind a car to avoid being seen.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First dog to be seen in the series.  Ron and Kim are frightened by the dog.  Ron yells, ''Cheese and slobbers!''  Mr. Barkin will later exclaim, ''Cheese and crackers!'' when shocked and surprised.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A car pulls up.  Some men get out shouting, ''Steel!''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron backtrack, and find a door.  But it is locked.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim decides to go to the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts her arm around Ron's waist before they both go up.  Kim does this from now on since Ron doesn't have his own grappling hook.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron slips and falls off the roof.  Kim flips down, bounces off a wall, grabs Ron, and then swings back up to a ventilation shaft.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ventilation shaft takes Kim and Ron to the center of the Middleton Mall.  It is hosting a GWA special event.  First mention of the GWA.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim scolds Ron for trying to get into the mall through an alternate route instead of the main entrance.  The entire beginning was done to make it look as though Kim and Ron were in danger by men wanting to hurt them.<br/>

<img src="images/pain_king/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron's mission might have been in the desert or a dry area.  Their clothes are dusty.  Kim indicates she like to go home and change after a mission.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Kim that there wasn't enough time.  The first one hundred fans not to get trampled get a free GWA tour t-shirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has never heard of the GWA.  Ron indicates it stands for Global Wrestling Association.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shouts, ''Steel Toe rules!''  This indicates who his favorite wrestler is.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The men from the dark ally walk by.  All are now shouting, ''Pain!''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron talks about Steel Toe and Pain King's gimmicks.  Pain King has a bionic eye that can cause people to feel pain.  Steel Toe was in a freak industrial accident that gave him a titanium foot.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Jackie Oakes.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that Jackie Oakes is the founder of the GWA.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie is short.  He's so short, he needs a box to stand on to look taller than he actually is.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King make their appearances at the podium.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains that she's in the mall, but not shopping.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wants Kim to stay.  He explains that wrestling is more that two people beating each other up; it's also a war of words.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The war of words consists of Steel Toe and Pain King shouting, ''You're going down!'' to each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells Ron that Club Banana is doing a tie-in the museum's Cleopatra's Closet exhibit.  She then leaves Ron to shop.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Monique.  She indicates that Kim is looking at ''Cleo's cargos.''  Club Banana has been decorated in ancient Egyptian style to reflect the museum's tie-in.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br>Kim and Monique both tell each other at the same time they would look good in ''Giza green.''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pain King calls Steel Toe, ''Leadfoot.''  Steel Toe and Pain King begin fighting.  Jackie breaks them up and tells them to save it for ''Mayhem in Middleton.''  This is the name of the Middleton wrestling event.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King begin fighting again.  This gets the audience to start fighting.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron accidentally gets involved in the fighting too.<br/> <br/><img src="images/pain_king/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked, Kim indicates that she's a charter member of the Club Banana club.  The card Kim has is not the same Club Banana card in Low Budget.  Monique suddenly went from blue shirt to red shirt.  This is not too surprising considering that Kim and Monique were trying on prom dresses in So The Drama, and business appears to be slow right now.  Monique wears this combination red shirt and red miniskirt for most of the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique thought she recognized Kim.  Monique introduces herself and indicates she just moved to Middleton, and starts at Middleton High on Monday.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim notices the angry mob.  Ron is thrown into a mosh pit.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim rushes into the crowd to save Ron.  Everyone is fighting, including two women.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After saving Ron, Jackie Oakes asks Kim if she would ever consider a career in professional wrestling.  Kim turns him down.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie gives Kim two tickets to Mayhem in Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates the two tickets are actually back stage passes.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim accidentally calls Steel Toe, ''Steel Cage.''  <br/><br/>\<img src="images/pain_king/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gives Ron the tickets.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The fighting crowd is suddenly dispersed.  Ron suggests to Kim that they go back to her house and watch wrestling.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br>Kim has other plans.  Kim is going to the Cleopatra's Closet exhibit at the Middle Art Museum.  It's a special preview for Club Banana frequent buyers.<br/><img src="images/pain_king/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron calls the wrestling event on tonight ''Steel Toe's night of one hundred bruises.''  The real name of the event is revealed later in the episode.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, ''Cleopatra . . . Like anybody's gonna remember her ten years from now.''  The irony of this line is that Cleopatra was an Egyptian queen from ancient times and not likely to be ever forgotten.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Middleton Art Museum.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim meets up with Monique.  Both are wearing Giza green cargo pants.  Kim is also wearing a pink tank top.  Kim obviously  went home and changed.  Monique wears this combination blue shirt and Giza green cargos periodically throughout the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique indicates there is an exclusive preview for the queen's accessories.  Monique has dot eyes in Season 1.  In Season 2, her eyes become normal.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the museum tour guide.  Some of the background people in this scene were also at the mall.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The exhibit is quickly stopped after a security guard is found tied and gagged.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim advises the tour guide to call security and stay together.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim contacts Wade and asks him to tap into the security cameras.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim hears footsteps and sees a door clothes.  She goes after whoever just left.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door leads directly to the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A bright light begins shining from the air unit.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When Kim investigates, a large dog-like creature jumps out from behind and begins running away.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The creature jumps from the roof of the museum to another roof several stories down.  Kim is left behind.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/pain_king/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is watching wrestling with Jim and Tim.  First indication of how well Ron gets along with Jim and Tim.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim rushes in to talk to Ron.  Jim, Tim, and Ron all shush her.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls Kim.  Kim is shushed again by Jim, Tim, and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes to the other side of the house so she won't disturb her brothers or Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates the only thing stolen was a small talisman.  It was a gift to Cleopatra given to her by a high priest of Anubis, the ancient Egyptian god of mummification.  The talisman was supposedly enchanted to give the wearer super human strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim thinks that Cleopatra would have preferred some nice earrings instead.  She is thankful the talisman doesn't grant immortality.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The GWA event before Middleton was called, ''Chaos in Chicago.''  A commercial for Pop Pop Porter's mini corn dogs comes on.  The full version of this commercial will be played in a later episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes over during the commercial break to ask about ''the queen's old clothes.''  Kim mentions meeting Monique, and the museum being robbed by ''some glowing animal headed guy.''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron demands to know who Monique is.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries to talk about the museum robbery.  Ron wants to hear more about Kim's new friend, Monique.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suggests they go to Bueno Nacho and talk.  Kim turns him down, saying that she and Monique stopped by for smoothies on the way home.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron goes to Bueno Nacho by himself.  First time Ron talks to Rufus about his personal problems since Kim isn't there to listen to him.  Ron indicates that Kim doesn't drink smoothies.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron worries that Kim will start doing her own things, and that will lead Ron to doing his own things, and their friendship would soon end.  Ron hopes for the best, and that everything will be back to normal the next day.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Indication the Possible home has a doorbell.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Possible front door.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks if Kim is ready for school.  This indicates that Kim and Ron go to school together often.  Mrs. Possible explains that Kim left to meet up with Monique.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible wears a fashionable watch with hands that tell time, not digital.  The time is almost 8:00.  Mrs. Possible begins to hurry so she won't be late for a cranial bypass.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible leaves the door wide open and unlocked.  Most likely she expects Ron to lock the house up when he leaves.  This indicates how much trust Mrs. Possible has in Ron.  She also tells Ron to say ''Hi!'' to his parents for her.  This indicates that Mrs. Possible knows Mr. and Mrs. Stoppable at least on a casual level.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the school cafeteria lunch lady.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells Monique about how she once rescued a desert prince from a death squad.  Her skirt was caught on the back of her underwear.  This could help explain why Kim doesn't wear skirts or dresses too often.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron interferes with a bag from the Donut-y pastry shop.  This is not the same doughnut shop in Partners.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron worms his way between Kim and Monique.  He'll try to do this again in So The Drama with Kim and Eric.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron offers Monique a bear claw.  Monique turns it down, joking she's a vegetarian.  Ron doesn't get the joke.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron forcibly explains that he is Kim's sidekick.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Sensing that something is wrong, Monique leaves and claims she has to get to class.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique left her lunch tray.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When Kim asks what the problem is, Ron explains that he feels excluded from Kim by Monique.  Ron will deal with this again in So The Drama, between Kim and Eric.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Kim about his friend from the second grade, Billy Bullwicky.  Ron indicates that they grew apart because they were getting older.  This is another issue Ron deals with Kim in So The Drama.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to lure Kim back with the wrestling tickets.  Kim tells Ron that she already made plans with Monique.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron blames the smoothies for Kim excluding Ron to be with Monique.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gives the two tickets to Kim, then takes one back so he can see the show.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Middleton Arena.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King talk casually while getting ready for the show.  This indicates the two are actually friends.  Steel Toe indicates that he rented a cottage in Martha's Vineyard with his wife and kids for a vacation.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>There's a knock on the door.  Pain King and Steel Toe immediately begin talking about how much they hate each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie opens the door.  Steel Toe and Pain King are relieved he wasn't a reporter.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie asks if he can get into the ring with Steel Toe and Pain King.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie is turned down because of his small size, and because he's much better as a promoter.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie walk out of the dressing room.  It is then revealed that Jackie is the thief of the talisman.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron brags about his backstage passes.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The same security guard is guarding the ring and the backstage.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron passes Tricia Lebowski getting an interview from a man suggesting that golf is a contact sport.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Other wrestlers are casually waiting for their turn to go on.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sits in a chair and sees his idol Steel Toe approaching.  The woman in the background may be a female wrestler.  It's unconfirmed since her body is cut off from the frame.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pain King has his hand on Steel Toe's shoulder.  This is another indication that the two are actually friends.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron proclaims that he's close enough to touch Steel Toe.  But he won't because ''he's cool.''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron touches Steel Toe anyways.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe mistakenly calls Rufus a gerbil. <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks for an autograph on his chest.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King wonders where Jackie is.  Apparently, Jackie provides pens for autographs and Steel Toe's sunglasses.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Steel Toe that he'll get them.  Steel Toe indicates they're in his dressing room.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie set up a miniature alter in one of the dressing rooms.  It consists of candles and burning incense.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>To do the magic spell, Jackie needs open toed sandals, the talisman, and the ancient papyrus with the incantation.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The papyrus may be ancient, but it's written in English.  It reads, ''Anubus, Protector of the Tomb, Your time is now, The time of doom!  Jackie reads this aloud to activate the spell.  Anubus is misspelled.  It should be spelled as Anubis.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron walks into the wrong dressing room.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees Jackie change into a altered form.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is thrown of the dressing room and into a wall.  The wall cracks from the pressure.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron then hit's the floor and is little phased by the throw.  This is another indication of Ron's resilience.  For some reason, dishes and food are on the floor.  Perhaps the room that Jackie made into an alter was originally for a catered meal, and he moved it into the hallway.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus hides under a nearby piece of lettuce.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie is surrounded with magical energy and makes himself taller.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jackie announces himself as ''The Jackal.''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A size comparison from Ron to the Jackal.  Also an indication that The Jackal has super strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is thrown from the dressing room into the arena.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King have already begun wrestling when they are interrupted by Ron slamming face into Steel Toe.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Some people cheer.  Other boo.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is light enough for Pain King to lift him up with one hand.  Again, Ron is unhurt.  Another indication of Ron's resilience.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal comes into the ring.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the coffee shop.  Monique indicates that Kim is drinking a latte.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Although cut off half way, the museum tour guide is also in the coffee shop.  Kim admits to feeling bad for ditching Ron to be with Monique.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Ron isn't into coffee shop atmosphere.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim then indicates that Ron went to see wrestling.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique indicates she likes wrestling.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets unnerved by Monique admitting she likes wrestling.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique indicates she has a brother who got her interested in wrestling.  She also indicates she likes Pain King.  Kim finds it difficult to believe that Monique and Ron have something in common.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim.  He indicates that if an incantation from an ancient text is read, the spirit of Anubis could possess the person who reads it.  He also indicates that the ancient text was stolen from the University of Chicago.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks Wade for access to the police report.  Wade pulls it up, even though it is confidential.  <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The report must have said that the thief was super short.

This explains why he wanted supernatural powers.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal lifts Steel Toe and Pain King with one hand.  Another indication of how strong he is.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The wrestling fan in red thinks that The Jackal is ''awesome!''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries his negotiation skills to save Pain King and Steel Toe.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal fires beams from his eyes that hit Ron and sends him flying backwards into a ring post.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries to be nice as she squeezes through the standing crowd.

The two slam into each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The crowd enjoys the carnage.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal indicates he'll take on anyone in a no holds barred grudge match.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal gets booed by some fans.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal shoots his eye beams at the banner, causing some of it to burn away in flames.  This indicates that Jackal's eye beams have fire capabilities.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal shoots a fireball from his hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal sets the banner of Steel Toe on fire with the green fireball. <br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal then summons a powerful whirlwind.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The fan in red thinks that Jackal's powers are just special effects.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron corrects Kim when she mistakenly calls body slammed, ''bodyslammered.''<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The whirlwind stops as soon as Ron grabs The Jackal's leg.  Unfortunately, Ron isn't strong enough to do anything.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Jackal kicks Ron away into the ropes.

The Jackal lifts Kim up, then drops her.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is back up on his feet and ready to fight again.

Everyone begins to panic.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim's new plan: Get Steel Toe and Pain King to help be the distraction while she gets the talisman.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Steel Toe and Pain King refuse to help.  Ron then uses his negotiation skills to persuade them because they're considered heroes.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The two children looking up in admiration convince Steel Toe and Pain King to help Ron.  Minor clapping can be heard in the background, even though the children are not clapping.  A minor mistake.

Now it remains black.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pain King picks Jackie up, twirls him around a few times, then throws him out of the ring.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The fan in red thought the show was the best he'd ever seen.

Kim is still disappointed that Monique likes wrestling.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Monique have a burrito eating contest.  The first one to drip loses.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus drops the napkin to start the eating competition.  This is a reference to American drag street racing, where (most often it is a young woman) drops a cloth to begin the race.<br/><br/><img src="images/pain_king/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim says, ''I think this the beginning of a very weird friendship.''  This is a take on the classic line from the movie Casablanca, in which Humphrey Bogart says, ''I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.''  This is the last line of the movie, much like this was the last line of the episode.<br/>
