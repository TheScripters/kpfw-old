Show notes: Kim sees Ron’s loser status in Mind Games.  She then sees Ron nearly getting killed by Monkey Fist in Monkey Fist Strikes.  Kim now tries to change Ron into the kind of man she wants.  This episode begins Kim’s second crushing phase on Ron.  This episode also introduces Senior Senior Senior, Senior Senior Junior, Francois, and Amelia.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Francois.  He speaks with a French accent.   He says her last name in French.   Francois holds his hands up like a Hollywood director seeing how his subject will look on film.

Kim reminds Ron that getting Francois to make a house call is “epic.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Francois indicates that he is repaying Kim back for helping his poodle.

Kim indicates she knows what is best for Ron.  Mrs. Possible isn’t so sure.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Francois calls Ron by his full first name Ronald.  Francois thinks that Ron’s old barber has trouble seeing.  Ron indicates this is correct. <br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible thinks that Francois is cutting Ron’s hair too short.  Kim trusts Francois.  Rufus has his eyes covered.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Le’ Goop.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Francois indicates that only a pea sized amount of Le’ Goop is used.

This indicates that Ron ditched school.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he has a cowlick problem with his hair.  It’s become unmanageable.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus lies on Ron’s hair to hold it down.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s hair springs up and sends Rufus flying.

The pilot agrees, but then comments on Ron’s cowlick.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Francois suggests Ron get a new wardrobe to go with his haircut.  Francois indicates the hair and the clothes have to harmonize.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Francois’ shop is called “Haute D’Style.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron flirts with a French woman walking by.  Kim’s idea of turning Ron into what she wants as a boyfriend has already backfired.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The French woman blows Ron a kiss, then loses her balance on the stairs.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn’t realize Kim is getting jealous.  He thinks she is getting tweaked because everyone notices his new hairstyle.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Two French girls walk by.  One blows Ron a kiss while the other says, “Bonjour.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she is tweaked because hair care products are suddenly the center of everyone’s universe.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>All the lights suddenly go out throughout the city.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim contacts Wade.

Junior has a super sized sun lamp on so he can sunbathe at night.  This explains why Europe is without power.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs Ron’s hand and jumps.  Ron isn’t ready yet.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron lands flat on his back.  He gets up and is fine.  Kim is annoyed.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim calls out to Junior.  Junior thinks they are new servants.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Senior Senior Senior.  The door opens and has the same sound effect as the old Star Trek television series.  Ricardo Montalban, who provided the voice for Senior, played a character in both the old series and the second movie “The Wrath Of Khan.”  Earl Boen took over for the voice of Senior when Montalban’s health started to fail.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior asks Kim and Ron if they brought more light bulbs.  Kim ignores the question.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior says, “We have only just turned everything on.”  This indicates that the Seniors have moved to their private island only recently.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Junior both have the same hairstyle and both indicate they use Le’ Goop.  It is revealed in a later episode that Junior is a customer for Francois.  Junior criticizes Ron’s choice of clothing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates he was about to go skiing down his indoor mountain.  He invites Kim and Ron to join him.  First indication that Senior likes to do extreme sports; a major plot point for a later episode.  He then offers them a box of juice.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron whispers to Kim that he wants to go skiing.  Kim elbows him for this comment.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>There is no indication as to what flavor the juice is.  It is simply a box with the word “juice” on it.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron imitates Junior doesn’t care attitude while Kim talks to Senior about energy conservation and eco awareness.  Kim does so with pamplets with energy and water saving tips.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>We don’t know if the Seniors have an aquarium inside their home, or if the window is connected to ocean.  In either case, large amounts of money would be required to fund the project.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests turning off the giant lamp.  Junior indicates he wants to be a teen pop star.  First mention from Junior that he wants to be a teen pop sensation.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior is very interested in a low flow showerhead.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suddenly begins telling the Seniors that their home is more like a lair.  Senior thinks that a liar sounds sinister.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron notes that the Seniors live on a private island, there is chrome everywhere, and the doors go “Whoosh!”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/212.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates that he likes the whoosh!  He believes it is the door saying, “I am closed.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suggests several things to turn the Senior’s home into a lair to take over the world including a communications jamming system, missiles, traps, self activating lasers, a secret underground grotto with a speedboat  for quick escapes, spinning tops of doom, and a lagoon filled with pirahna.  Ron will indicate in a later episode that a moat filled with pirahna is his favorite.  Message boards note this episode that Ron has the capability to become criminal and evil, as seen in the future episode Bad Boy.  But this capability seems to be an untapped potential, much like all of Ron’s abilities.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests florescent lighting.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drags Ron away, citing she has homework she needs to do.  She also calls Ron, “Mr. Spinning tops of doom.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior decides to try villainy at Ron’s suggestion because he needs a hobby.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/the_new_ron/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim wonder why Kim didn’t beat up Senior.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pours herself some water from the pitcher.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A vegetable plate is nearby Mr. Possible.  It appears to consist of carrots, pickles, and cauliflower.  Mr. Possible likes the idea of energy conservation.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible brings in the main course on a silver platter.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim almost gets sick at the site of brains for supper.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim want to eat some brains.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible makes Jim and Tim politely ask for brains to eat.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gags again when Mrs. Possible begins cutting the brain.  It is revealed in a later episode that Kim has a weak stomach when it comes to open surgery.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates that the brain is actually meat loaf.  She is making it for the neurosurgeon’s pot luck and wanted to try it out on her family first.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible changes the subject by asking about Ron.  Mr. Possible might be doing this since Ron isn’t having supper with them, and this isn’t his normal behavior.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks to be excused.  Mrs. Possible indicates she’ll save Kim a plate.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Things in Kim’s room are: A teddy bear, a basketball, an oversized video game controller (even though it’s revealed later that video games are not Kim’s thing), a comfort chair, a cd holder, a radio, a computer, two books, a telescope, and a cheerleading trophy.  It has been wondered why Kim’s telescope is always pointed down, leaving many to think Kim likes to spy on her neighbors.  The cheerleading trophy most likely is from when Kim won the cheerleading regionals in Mind Games.  A banner on the wall says, “Go Mad Dogs.”  Kim calls Ron by using speed dial.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has a lava lamp, a computer, and an entertainment system by his bed in his room.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has a new picture of himself with his new haircut and some flashy clothes.  His telephone is capable of message recordings.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim decides to page Ron instead.

Rufus tries to show it to Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is covered with an article of clothing.  We don’t know if Ron did this to ignore the pager, or if he forgot about Rufus on the floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible comes up to Kim’s room to talk about Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible tells about how in his college days, he constuctred a mechanical suit with a plasma blaster for a lab mouse named Pinky Joe Curlytail.  Mr. Possible did so because he hated the psychology majors who made Pinky Joe run around in mazes all day.  Pinky Joe blew up half the science building.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible leaves.  Mrs. Possible comes up with Kim’s supper.  Mrs. Possible hints that Kim doesn’t know what was best for Ron when she made him get a new haircut.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Numerous school girls take notice of Ron’s new look.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This seems to be the start when Tara began crushing on Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is left speechless by Ron’s new look.  Kim will do the same to Ron later in the episode Emotion Sickness.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s new look.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron goes to lunch with Amelia arm in arm.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim compares Ron to Pinky Joe Curlytail, knowing that a small change was for the worse.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is on his own and nearly stepped on when classes let out.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is rescued by Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is willing to reveal his secret to girls who are admiring him: Le’ Goop and it’s tagline “The secret is the sea urchin.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Though she doesn’t say anything, Kim tells the crushing girls to leave her Ron alone.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drags Ron into the hallway and demands to know why he’s changed so much.  Ron indicates he is a new person now.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim scolds Ron for leaving Rufus which led him to almost getting hurt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reverts back to the old Ron for a few seconds.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus jumps forward to give Ron a hug.  Ron stops him because it might mess up his hair.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim scolds Ron for excluding Rufus.  It could be analyzed that Kim is scolding Ron for excluding her from his life too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he doesn’t have pockets to carry Rufus.  He also indicates that his pants are pleather.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amelia comes and asks Ron to walk her to history class.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Amelia walk together arm in arm.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts Rufus in her pants pocket.  Kim indicates that Rufus will be staying at her locker.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Rufus stare longingly at a picture of Kim and Ron acting goofy.  Kim moved the picture of Shego to the side to fit the picture of her and Ron.  Kim indicates she preferred Ron like he was instead of how he is now.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contact Kim.  He indicates that the Seniors have sucked up all of Western Europe’s power on purpose.  Wade appears to be drinking fruit punch.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior made a recording in which he indicates he will continue taking all the power from Europe unless the Euro Alliance gives him their islands.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior is interested in the beaches and disco.  First indication that Junior likes disco dancing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade can’t believe how amateur the Seniors are.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs Rufus and intends to save Europe.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/the_new_ron/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Seniors black out the cities of Paris, London, and Venice.

Senior and Junior will go through the rest of the series practicing their evil laughs.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior asks Junior if he had heard anything from the Euro Alliance.  Junior indicates someone called, but he failed to take a message.  First indication that Junior does not share his father’s ambition to take over the world or be evil.  <br/><img src="images/the_new_ron/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior pounds on the table and demands his son to be more ambitious.
