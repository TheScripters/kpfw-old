Show notes: This is the second episode that deals with Ron’s mystical monkey power, and shows how he begins to get over his fear of monkeys.  It also introduces Frederick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Monkey Fist’s monkey ninjas.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist wore this same outfit when he stole the mystical monkey idol in Monkey Fist Strikes.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkey ninjas display an amazing amount of strength and skill by destroying the martial art training posts.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist takes off the hood and indicates that he and his monkey ninjas are ready.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It is customary to bow to the master in martial arts as a sign of honor and respect.  The monkeys to this to Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist pushes a single button.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This causes the shade to rise up.  It must be held by very thin wires, as they cannot be seen.  The shade is very similar to the one Monkey Fist used in Monkey Fist Strikes.  However, although the monkey symbol on the left is the same, the monkey symbol on the right is completely different.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Behind the shade was a shrine.  It includes a stand, a monkey statue, incense, and a paper with symbols.  The paper may be ancient, or it could be a copy.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist reveals the symbols on the paper.  He indicates that a prophecy foretells that when a team of monkey ninjas stand ready, and the golden banana has been returned on it’s golden stand, the ultimate monkey master will receive a sign.  Monkey Fist puts the banana on the small golden stand, and believes he is the ultimate monkey master.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist sits on the floor, which is customary in Japan.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The banana shakes, then peels like a real banana.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A ghostly appearance of a man appears.  His clothes and lack of hair seems to indicate that he may be a disciple of Buddah, and may even be a Shaolin monk.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly image causes Monkey Fist to jump for a second.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly image has a monkey on his shoulder.  He can also speak perfect English.  He indicates it is time to anoint the ultimate monkey master.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist immediately assumes that he is the ultimate monkey master.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly image tells Monkey Fist that he has to seek the brightest monkey, follow him to the stars, and there the ultimate monkey master will be unstoppable.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When the ghostly image disappears, it turns the monkey statue and the paper it was holding into ash.  The incense is no longer burning.  The banana goes back to being unpeeled.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist immediately believes that he will be the ultimate monkey master, and still has plans to rule the world.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist jumps high in the air, lands, and strikes a pose with his monkey ninjas.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible prepares breakfast.  Kim comes into the kitchen mad, and sits down like something is bothering her.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible puts a glass of water on the table, then asks which is bothering Kim: School or villains.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains that her father is making her go to the rocket booster’s open house at the space center.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible suggests Kim talk to her father.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that talking to her father about her growing up makes him all goofy.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim didn’t realize her father was right behind her when she says this.  Mr. Possible ignores her and indicates he found their matching rocket booster’s sweatshirts.  Kim’s sweatshirt is tiny in comparison to how she is now.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates Mr. Possible got the rocket booster sweatshirt when she was eight years old.  Mr. Possible indicates that was when they had their very first rocket booster day.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands help from her mother in dealing with her father.  Mrs. Possible suggests that Kim might be getting too old for the rocket boosters.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible tries to entice Kim by indicating there will be rocket shaped cookies.  Despite it’s small size, Kim manages to put on the sweatshirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The doorbell rings.  Kim’s sweatshirt reveals her belly, much like all her clothes do.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is at the door, and is excited to attend the rocket booster’s open house.  He too is wearing a rocket booster’s sweatshirt.  This scene is a clear indication to Ron’s childlike nature, which will become a major issue in the future.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she doesn’t want to attend the rocket booster’s open house.  Ron and Rufus don’t want to miss the rocket shaped cookies.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkey ninjas practice martial arts.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkey ninjas know how to use ancient weapons like staffs as well.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist uses a computer and the internet to find the brightest monkey.  This scene indicates that Monkey Fist knows how to type.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist finds a streaming video from the Blandsfield Zoo, showing the escape attempt of Digger McDirt.  This monkey is smart enough to use a shovel and tries to escape by digging.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Digger has tried seventeen times to escape, and has been captured every time.  Monkey Fist becomes unimpressed with Digger after reading this.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist then finds a streaming video of a monkey wearing a robe, glasses, and reading The Examiner newspaper.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The background character calls the monkey, “Mr. Jiggy.”  He is holding the same sundress that Nana Possible tried to give Kim in The Golden Years.  The background character tries to get the monkey to wear the sundress and go out with his boss.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It is revealed that the monkey is on a television sitcom comedy show called “Life With Mr. Jiggy.”  This also indicates that the background character is an actor.  The inspiration for this may have been the televison show Mr. Smith, which was a short lived comedy in the early 1980’s about a talking orangutan who was super smart.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist loses interest in this monkey, because his talent should not be wasted doing sitcom television.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist then finds a picture of monkey in a space suit.  Monkey Fist believes this is the monkey who will complete the prophecy by leading him to the stars.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>We saw what the Middleton space center looks like on the inside in Attack Of The Killer Bebes.  Here we see what it looks like from outside the gate.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Frank, the security guard.  He waves and says “Hi!” to Kim, but not to Ron.  This is most likely because Frank has not seen or heard of Ron so much as he has Kim, since Mr. Possible works at the space lab.  Excited, Ron is bouncing in the back seat.  Mr. Possible indicates that they are all here for the annual rocket booster’s open house.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frank suggests that the rocket booster’s open house is for little kids.  Mr. Possible disagrees with Frank because Kim is his little girl.  Mr. Possible calls Kim, “Kimmie Cub.”<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frank sees that Mr. Possible is having trouble seeing Kim growing up.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is enjoying the cookies while Kim is annoyed with seeing all the young children around her.  One of the children remarks that Kim might be her babysitter.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible comes in begins treating Kim like a little kid.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible introduces himself to the children.  They all say, “Good morning, Dr. Possible.” in unison.  This is typical for children when they are put into large groups.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates he started the rocket booster’s club to show Kim the exciting things they do around the space lab.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Displaying some of his scientific knowledge, Ron names off a part of the rocket, then takes a bite of the rocket shaped cookie he is eating.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Possible indicates the rocket booster’s open house is an annual event, and a good way to spend time with Kim.  Kim resents being hugged by her father.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible begins the tour, and wants to introduce the newest astronaut.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible introduces Frederick.  Frederick is playing the same video game that Ron and Rufus played at the beginning of Coach Possible.  The sound effects from the video game come from the Atari version of Pac-Man.  Frederick uses the keypad on his wrist to talk.  This is similar to the movie Congo, in which a gorilla used a device attached to it’s arms, and a voice was heard based on sign language movements.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick takes off the space helmet, and is revealed to be a monkey.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees a monkey and begins to scream.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick seems drawn to Ron.  He grabs Ron’s leg and drags him over to play the video game.  Ron begins yelling, “No monkey touch!”<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The other children wonder why Ron is afraid of Frederick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells the children about Ron’s summer at Camp Wannaweep and how he didn’t get along with the camp’s mascot, Bobo the chimp.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron snaps back into reality, and shows his disapproval for Frederick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick wants to be Ron’s friend, and jumps onto Ron to give him a hug.  Ron obviously doesn’t like this.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The children all think the Ron and Frederick are just sooooo cute.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron begins to freak out, and calls out to Rufus for help.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus gets into Frederick’s arm, and pushes it out to make him let go of Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick lets go of Ron, and then lands on the floor.  The children rush over to see Frederick up close.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron decides to leave the space center because of Frederick, and demands to know if Kim is coming with him.  Kim does want to leave with Ron, right after she has a talk with her father.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes over to talk to her father.  Mr. Possible gives her another hug, and indicates he feels a fatherly/daughterly connection with her.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suddenly can’t tell her father that she is too old for the rocket booster’s open house.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Instead, she grabs Ron and says she has to show him something.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible shows the children a rocket and indicates it is going to send Frederick to a space station for a whole year.  Frederick will monitor science experiments from elementary students from around the country.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The space lab is suddenly invaded by monkey ninjas.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door is blocked with a quarterstaff.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist then shows up intending on fulfilling the prophecy.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron walk to the entrance/exit of the space center. <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim believes she should have said something to her father.  Ron consoles her and then complains about the monkey.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim decides to go back and talk to her father.  Ron suggests writing a letter because everybody likes to get letters.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron fail to notice that Frank is tied up.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The front doors to the space lab are made with highly polished glass that shows Kim and Ron‘s reflection.  Kim is surprised the doors won‘t open.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus examines the door and concludes they are locked.  Ron suggests that the locked doors are a sign that he needs to get away from the monkey.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim looks through the glass door but doesn’t see anything.  She decides to check the side door.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The side door is locked too.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees the cars in the parking lot and knows that everybody should be inside the building.  Therefore the doors should not be locked.  Kim knows something isn’t right.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim contacts Wade for assistance.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Three more children show up mysteriously now that Monkey Fist has shown up.  This one seems interested in the monkey ninja.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible grabs the curious child and brings him closer to him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist comes in and indicates he is only here for Frederick.  Mr. Possible argues this indicating that Frederick is for an important mission.  Monkey Fist indicates he is going with Frederick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade tells Kim that the space center’s computer is being jammed.  Wade concludes that there must be trouble on the inside.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist becomes annoyed by one of the kids staring at him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kid remarks about Monkey Fist’s hairy hands.  Monkey Fist stands on them, and then shows off his hairy feet.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kid thinks that Monkey Fist is cool.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible tries to argue against stealing a rocket ship.  Monkey Fist argues that he is trying to fulfill a ancient prophecy.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick doesn’t want to go.  Monkey Fist convinces him by threatening the children.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron see that Monkey Fist is behind the space lab lockdown.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron duck down out of sight.  Ron thinks Frederick is a traitor and is working with Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim ignores Ron’s theory and contacts Wade again.  Kim asks for a way in with help from the space lab blueprints.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade isn’t sure he can get blueprints to a top secret lab because of the encryption.  Despite this, it only takes Wade four seconds to get them.  Wade indicates the best way in is through an air vent on the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes her grappling gun out of her backpack and shoots it to the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Not having his own grappling gun, Ron grabs Kim and holds her tightly.  This is considered by Kim/Ron shippers as one of the best shipping scenes from Season 1.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist threatens to take care of anyone who comes to the space station.  He also claims that from there, he will be able to rule the world.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is looking forward to having access to advanced space weapons.  He is shocked when Mr. Possible indicates that there are no weapons on the space station, because it is dedicated to peaceful research.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist reiterates that Frederick is the one to fulfill the prophecy by leading them to the stars.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist takes Frederick by the hand and exit’s the room.  The monkey ninjas follow.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron can’t lift the grate.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim looks through her backpack to find something that can help them get through the grate.  Kim finds smoke pellets, lip gloss, and today’s history homework.  Ron wants to see the history homework, but Kim won’t let him cheat.  Kim and Ron may have been excused for a few hours from school so they could attend the rocket booster’s open house.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pulls out Rufus to get through the grate.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus bites through the steel grate.  Sometimes Rufus can bite through stuff; other times he can’t.  This could be attributed to whether or not he is using mystical monkey power.  Since Monkey Fist is nearby, it seems most plausible that Rufus tapped into his power to bite through the grate.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron come down through a hole in the roof.  Ron struggles not to fall, and lands okay.  Kim is already on the floor and waiting for him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist comes into the hallway and sees Kim and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus hides in Ron’s pocket.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist demands to know what Kim and Ron are doing there.  This indicates that Monkey Fist doesn’t know that the man he was just talking to was Kim’s father.  Ron explains about the rocket booster’s open house, and the rocket shaped cookies.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pushes Ron aside and tells Monkey Fist they are there to stop him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist tells his monkey ninjas to attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs away.  The monkey ninjas chase after him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Monkey Fist begin fighting.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick grabs onto Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim jumps toward Monkey Fist.  Monkey Fist throws Frederick at Kim.  The two collide in mid air.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>They land in a closet, with Frederick on top of Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist grabs Frederick.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist closes the door.  It is locked.  Kim can’t open the door.<br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs down randam hallways to escape the monkey ninjas gaining on him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees a red door with a large blue button.  He pushes it.  The door slides up to open.  Ron goes through to escape.  The monkey ninjas go past.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron concludes he is in some sort of science lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The room suddenly begins to shake.  From the outside, we see a large tank like crane lift the science lab up.  It was attached on the floor with a large hose.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The crane lifts the lab up into an open slot in the rocket.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Doors close over the lab.  The rocket is sealed.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist demands everyone get into a seatbelt.  He also demands Frederick take the pilot seat.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A scientist tries to put in a password into the computer.  Access is denied.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The scientist with the beard indicates that Monkey Fist has locked out the computer system.  Mr. Possible indicates they can’t halt the launch.  They have no choice but listen to the ten second countdown.  It is revealed that the background character behind Mr. Possible also has a job at the space center.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is surprised to see Frederick is making a daring escape.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick opens the door to the rocket by pushing a large green button.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door is circular in shape, and easy for Frederick to get through.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist can’t get out of his seatbelt to get Frederick back.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick jumps from the door of the rocket to the mechanical ramp that is retaining.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The rocket thrusters are activated.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is out of his seatbelt and frantically trying to get the door open by banging on it.  Monkey Fist either doesn’t know how to open the door, or is panicked and forgotten how to do it.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron feels the shaking and hears how loud the rocket is.  He concludes he must be really close to it.  He doesn’t realize he is actually inside of it.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>An unsecured container of spiders is right over Ron.  This indicates that the space lab was unprepared for the flight.  This is encouraged since Monkey Fist disabled the computer.  The crane that hoisted the space lab must have been unmanned, and controlled by the computer.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The scientists watch as the rocket zooms off into space.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible is worried about Frederick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim brings Frederick into the space lab.  Frederick most likely unlocked the closet door that Kim was trapped in.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible hugs Kim again.  This annoys Kim.  Kim explains that she was on the way back to talk to him when she and Ron ran into Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A scientist indicates there is a camera to monitor the spiders in the space lab that was put into the rocket.  The monitor shows Ron desperately trying to get the spiders off.  This shows Ron’s fear of insects, that first occurred when Ron was at Camp Wannaweep.  This was revealed in the episode Tick Tick Tick.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands her father get the rocket turned around.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The scientist indicates the spiders are harmless.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim reminds the scientist that Ron is on a rocket heading out into space with Monkey Fist, and is definitely in danger.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible explains that Monkey Fist changed the controls manual, therefore they can’t turn the rocket around.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates they need to go and rescue Ron.  The scientist disagrees indicating there is no trained crew or a rocket ship.<br/><br/> <img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible shows off his rocket ship he designed while he had some free time.  It is most likely based on the French airliner Concord.<br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The scientist indicates that the rocket is experimental.  Showing some Possible overconfidence, Mr. Possible is absolutely certain that it will fly.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she is going to rescue Ron.  Suddenly Mr. Possible isn’t so sure about Kim flying around in an experimental aircraft.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim lists some of the dangers she has been through.  These include  that she has up the Amazon, down a volcano, dog sledded through the Artic, swam the English Channel, scaled Mt. Everest, and aced the cheerleading regionals.  It’s unknown whether or not Ron did all of these things with Kim.  However, some of these events did occur in the show.  Kim went up the Amazon in Tick Tick Tick.  She dog sledded through the Artic in Bueno Nacho.  And she aced the cheerleading regionals in Mind Games.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The scientist indicates that Kim doesn’t have the training to pilot a rocket ship.  Kim indicates that Frederick does have the training.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick indicates he will go and help rescue Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible and the scientist complain that they haven’t calculated the launch vectors, or the variables to a docking mission.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has already contacted Wade.  Wade hears what they need.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that by the time they are ready, they will have all relevant vectors and flight trajectories downloaded into the space center computer.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible is frustrated that Kim is able to leave.  The two scientists are amazed beyond belief at Wade’s abilities.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim hugs her father and tells him that she is growing up, and not his little girl anymore.  But he will always be her dad.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible announces they need to prepare for launch.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible communicates with Kim with a monitor and a microphone.  Kim is wearing a space suit and helmet.  She gives the monitor a thumbs up indicating there is a camera somewhere near it.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The rocket doesn’t take off like a regular rocket.  It takes off more like a plane does on a runway.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the space station.  The rocket previously used by Monkey Fist is already docked.  We will see Monkey Fist does have some aviation experience in a future episode.  So it was most likely Monkey Fist who was able to fly the rocket and dock it.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Frederick’s faceplate go up at the same exact time.  They must have been automatic.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible orders Frederick to reduce the booster jets to match speed of the space station.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick reduces the speed by pulling down two levers on the console.  The lever in the middle is already down.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The rocket lands like it takes off.  A landing strip has been prepared on the space station.  Frederick has trouble landing though.  Frederick lands on the runway.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick immediately must make a right angle turn.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick almost lost control of the rocket.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that the docking procedure is complete.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim looks up to see the rocket used by Monkey Fist.  The bay doors are now open explosing the space lab that Ron is in.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron bangs on the door trying to get it open.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus pushes number on the keypad at random.  Stars suddenly light up as Rufus accidentally cracks the code.  A chime for each star is heard, each one with a slightly higher pitch than the last.  Using a phone numbering system, the numbers pushed are * 1 8 8.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron picks up Rufus as the door open.  Ron fails to notice Monkey Fist or his monkey ninjas.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist grabs Ron.  Ron says, “Get your stinkin’ paws off me, you filthy monkey!”  This is a take on the classic line from the movie Planet Of The Apes.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus bites Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist lets Ron go.  But now he is very angry.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A back door to the lab opens up.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The shadowy figure reveals herself after removing her helmet.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is happy to see Kim.  Monkey Fist is very surprised.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/183.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron puts Rufus in his pocket and is dismayed when he sees Frederick.  Ron still thinks Frederick is working with Monkey Fist.  Kim explains that it was Frederick who brought her to the space station.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/184.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick uses the wrist communicator to tell Ron that he considers him a friend.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/185.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron begins to get chocked up about this.  Perhaps Ron feels regret for treating Frederick so badly.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is happy to see Frederick too.  He believes the prophecy is now back on track, and he will be the ultimate monkey master.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim throws her helmet at Monkey Fist, then gets into a fighting position.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron does a series of poses.  Ron is able to tap into his mystical monkey power.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/189.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Even Frederick isn’t afraid to take on Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/190.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist crushes Kim’s helmet in his hands.  Then he orders his monkey ninjas to attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/191.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkey ninjas don’t attack Ron or Frederick.  They all gang up on Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim does some cartwheels and flings the monkey off of her.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkeys use their agility and balance not to get hurt from Kim’s attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist sees Kim is preoccupied with the monkey ninjas.  He turns his attention onto Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Whatever material the small wall is made out of, Monkey Fist is able to break it into pieces as he attacks Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is able to dodge and block all of Monkey Fist’s attacks.  Ron did this previously with Kim and Shego in The Twin Factor.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron does a jump and tumbles to get away from Monkey Fist.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist does a backwards jump kick.  This hits Ron and he goes flying back.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is in daze.  Rufus pops out of Ron’s pocket.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist prepared to end Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus cover their eyes in anticipation.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The artificial gravity button is suddenly deactivated.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist misses Ron and begins floating in the air.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It is revealed that Frederick turned off the artificial gravity.  How he remains on the floor is unclear.  It is most likely that his shoes are magnetic, or he is wearing weights of some sort.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist then tries to attack Ron.  Ron kicks him and he goes flying backwards.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkeys ninjas all attack Kim at the same time.  Kim floats upwards.  The monkey ninjas miss Kim and run into each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim floats to the ceiling.  She pushes herself off and hits three monkey ninjas.  She then takes out the fourth.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is against the wall.  He launches himself at Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is against a wall too.  Ron grabs Rufus and kicks himself away.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist misses Ron and hits the wall instead.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/211.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron flies over to Kim, and grabs her.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/212.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Kim land on the floor.  Ron demands Frederick to turn the artificial gravity back on.  Message board participates couldn’t help but notice that Ron’s thumb is almost touching Kim’s breast.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick does so by using his tail to push the button.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/214.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist and his monkey ninjas fall and are stunned.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/215.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron rubs Frederick’s head.  Ron is finally beginning to get over his fear of monkeys.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/216.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is ready to go back home.  Frederick indicates he has to stay.  Kim explains that Frederick has a job to do at the space station.  Ron says, “But that means he’ll stay up here for a year.”  Mr. Possible announced to the children that Frederick was going to be up at the space station for a year.  At that point, Kim and Ron were about to leave the space propulsion center.  How Ron knows how long Frederick is going to be here at the space station is a mystery (or a minor mistake).<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/217.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Frederick indicates that he is going to miss Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Frederick he will send him an e-mail everyday.  The two hug.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The rocket lands back on earth.  Kim has trouble landing too.  The tires spark and nearly catch on fire.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The rocket comes to a complete stop and powers down.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A ramp opens toward the back as an exit for Kim and Ron.  Kim found a spare helmet somewhere.  Ron asks Kim how she knows how to fly a spacecraft.  Kim indicates she watched Frederick on the way up.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/222.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It was analyzed on the message boards that at this point in the series, Kim realizes to what point she is willing to go to save Ron, and is crushing on him.  Ron remains clueless about how Kim feels about him, after failing to notice any signals from her.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/223.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The number of children at the beginning was five.  Now it is eight.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron jumps out of the way while the children crowd Kim. Mr. Possible and the scientists come forward to welcome Kim back and praise her.  Frank and another security guard go inside the rocket for Monkey Fist.  The other security guard is the same one from the Blandsfield Zoo earlier in the episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/225.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>One of the young girls indicates she wants to be just like Kim when she grows up.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/226.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible admits that his little girl is no longer little.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/227.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes her father by the arm, indicating she still needs a dad at times.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/228.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible suddenly sets new rules for Kim’s life:  No boys and and no driving.  The no boys rule doesn’t apply to Ron.  How this applies to other boys (like Josh Mankey) later in Season 2 remains a mystery.  Many feel that Mr. Possible is too overprotective when it comes to boys and his daughter.  Kim will take driver’s ed in Season 2, but not start driving until Season 4.  Mr. Possible continues to make new rules, but we don’t get to hear them.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/229.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist is led down the ramp.  They stop in front of Ron.  Monkey Fist whines that he was supposed to be the ultimate monkey master and unstoppable.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/230.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist suddenly demands his monkey ninjas to attack.  Nothing happens.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/231.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates they captured Monkey Fist’s monkey ninjas.  Frank indicates there weren’t any monkey ninjas.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/232.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monkey Fist whines that his monkey ninjas abandoned him.  He is then led away by security.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/233.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders how the monkey ninjas just vanished.  It is legendary for ninjas to use stealth and somehow disappear from where they are.  <br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/234.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/235.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The monkey ninjas use the golden banana to resummon the ghostly image as before.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/236.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly image indicates he is here to correct his last message.  The ghostly figure misquoted something because his monkey can’t write very well.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/237.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly figure indicates that the leader of the monkey ninjas will not be unstoppable, it will be Ron Stoppable.  The ghostly figure apologizes for whatever confusion this has brought.  It is unlikely that Monkey Fist has heard this, as he is still trying to be the ultimate monkey master.  Ron has not heard this either, and has no idea that his destiny as a great warrior is before him.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/238.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ghostly figure also uses the modern slang phrase, “My bad.”  As he begins to disappear, the incense begins burning again.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_ninjas_in_space/239.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Later, Kim and Ron are dining at Bueno Nacho.  The monkey ninjas is really freaking Kim out.  Ron indicates he can’t get rid of them.<br/><br/>
