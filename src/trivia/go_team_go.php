Show notes: This episode gives us some background on Shego.  It was originally titled as “Family Reunion.”  This confused many KP fans, confusing them into thinking there was an unaired episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Go City.  Go City was originally supposed to be Chicago.  This was later changed.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, “If you can make it here, well then, you’ve made it here.”  This is a play on the popular phrase, “If you can make it here, then you can make it anywhere.”<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she cashed in a favor to go to Go City.  Kim is apprehensive about this.  Ron reassures her that it is worth it.  Cars passing along the street in the background include a police car, a small hatchback car, a truck, a van, a sports car, and a suv. <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim checks the kimmunicator to make sure they are going the right way.  The kimmunicator now doubles as a GPS unit.  Kim indicates that whatever it is they’re going to, it’s on the next block.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has an anxiety attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus comes out and helps Ron breath so he doesn’t hyperventilate.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is annoyed and indicates that Ron is getting worked up over another Bueno Nacho.  Ron indicates that it is the first Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is not impressed with the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho.  Ron tries to convince Kim that it could represent Bueno Nacho of the future.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Seeing the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho leaves Ron and Rufus breathless.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho is three to four stories high, not counting the hat.  The hat is another one or two stories high.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is really impressed with the salsa parade, which is bowls of salsa on conveyor belts. <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees that the orders are now automated.  There is nobody to work the counters.  The items ordered are displayed on large monitors overhead.  Also seating booths are on large tiers allowing hundreds to dine in and see the view.  There don’t appear to be any barriers to the side of the booths to keep people from falling.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron no longer will feel judged about how much food he orders now.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Hego.  He sees Ron and indicates that the Bueno Nacho corporation sent a memo stating that certain procedures are to be done in Ron’s case.  Hego’s hair and glasses may be a reference to comic book super hero Superman.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim states that Ron is harmless, therefore certain procedures aren’t necessary.  The manager decides not to take any kind of action, in honor of the grand day opening.  Ron tries to order off the automated menu.  It is revealed later in the episode that the naco was removed from the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho menu.  Ron may be having trouble finding the naco.  Also the corporate memo may also have pertained to this event.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Aviarius.  Aviarius comes in through the double automatic sliding doors and promises revenge.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron don’t know who Aviarius is.  They believe he is a villain who has come for revenge against them.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius calls for a condor to attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus hides deep in Ron’s pocket.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/go_team_go/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron dodge the giant condor’s attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim flips to the counter, then flips again and grabs the condor’s leg.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The condor squaks when Kim grabs his leg.  Condors don’t have vocal cords, so they wouldn’t necessarily squak.  A minor mistake.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim climbs on the condor’s back.  Kim says, “I hope you’re not one of the endangered ones.”  This is a reference to the California condor, which has been on the endangered species list since 1967.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The condor crashes into the salsa parade, and is stuck.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron whines about the loss of the salsa parade while the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho manager runs away.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager jumps behind the counter.  A flash of blue light is seen.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron picks up a flag from the salsa parade and waves it.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager reappears as a super hero.  He grabs the condor and throws it away.  There is some speculation that Team Go’s costume inspired the costumes for the Pixar super hero movie The Incredibles.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>He then tries to help Kim who might be trapped.  But Kim is safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius says, “Feel the wrath of Aviarius!”  This might be a play on a line from the video game Mortal Kombat 2.  Shoa Khan says, “Feel the wrath of Shao Khan!”<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius uses a staff with a diamond or crystal at the end.  It glows as it powers up.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius hits the super hero with a beam from his staff.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim jumps down, but lands in between the beam from the staff, and the super hero.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Though she doesn’t know it yet, Kim gains Hego’s power.  The staff suddenly stops.  Kim falls to the ground.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/316.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius sees that a mistake has been made.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Having lost his super power, Hego can’t hold the platform up.  It finally drops on him.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/317.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius stops to rant for a few seconds.  Meanwhile the salsa parade is still working in the background, indicating that it wasn’t completely destroyed.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius escapes on his condor promising revenge.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron wonder what happened to the super hero.  Kim and Ron don’t realize that the super hero and the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho manager are the same person.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager comes out and is straitening his tie.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho manager asks what happened.  Ron points to the direction Aviarius just left and says, “That bird guy---”<br/><br/> <img src="images/go_team_go/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager says the bird guy’s name: Aviarius.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks the manager if he knows Aviarius.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager looks worried and indicates that Aviarius said his name a lot.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked by Kim, the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho manager indicates he doesn’t know what Aviarius wanted, or who the super hero was.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron then asks how the manager knows that the super hero was indeed a super hero.  The manager indicates that he had glowing body parts.  Kim seems annoyed at Ron’s question to the manager.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This answer satisfies Ron, who is ready to go back inside the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho for a naco.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is ready for a naco too.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho manager indicates they don’t serve nacos.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This statement shocks Ron.  He is immediately ready to go back home now.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees that Kim isn’t feeling well.  Ron says, “We’ve got to get you back to Middleton, and get some nacos in you, stat!”  “Stat!” is a medical term in which something is needed immediately.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that ever since the trip to Go City, she has been feeling different.  Ron then complains about the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho not having the naco.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim opens her locker by turning it once to the left.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s hand begins to glow blue when she grabs the handle to her locker.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim rips the locker door off of it’s hinges.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim plays basketball with Monique, Tara, Hope, Crystal, and Liz.  They are most likely playing three against three.  It’s impossible to tell who has teamed up to play.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Monique has the ball and passes it over to Kim.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s feet begin to glow blue as she prepares to make a jump shot.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim jumps high into the air.  Then her hands glow blue as she slam dunks the basketball into the hoop.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The other girls are shocked and annoyed at Kim’s new ability.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is embarrassed at her lack of self control with her new powers.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Bonnie, Brick Flagg, and background students stand in line for the cafeteria.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/318.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The shadow behind Kim resembles Ron.  Whether or not this is actually Ron is not confirmed.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pizza is quickly snatched up.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie is about to grab the last slice.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Realizing she has super strength, Kim lifts the table with the pizza.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The pizza slice slides into Kim’s tray.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim walks by Bonnie smirking.  One of Kim’s worst qualities was her need to always beat Bonnie at everything.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim uses her super strength to hold up Tara, Hope, Marcella, Liz, and Crystal for a cheerleader super pose.  Crystal’s cheerleader underpants, also known as bloomers, can be seen as she does a handstand.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus are at Bueno Nacho.  Rufus is about to eat his nachos.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pulls the nachos away and indicates that they should wait for Kim.  It was analyzed that Ron is not seeing Bueno Nacho as the place where he and Kim are hanging out anymore; it has become their unofficial dating place.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim arrives.  She notices a car parked in front of a fire hydrant.  She uses her super strength to push it away.  It is against the law to park in front of a fire hydrant.  In case of a fire, the fire department needs access to fire hydrants for water.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is about to state that which Kim already knows: She has super strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager of Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho shows up.  He is looking for Kim.  Being world famous, he would have an easy time finding out Kim lived in Middleton.  Finding her at Bueno Nacho would have been done by following her there.  Ron annoys the manager by asking if he got transferred to the Middleton store, or fired because of the Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho doesn’t have the naco.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager indicates Kim has his super strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Go Tower.  It stands on the outside of Go City on a small rock island in the ocean.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager indicates that only a member of Team Go can open the door.  Since Kim has his super power, she has to open the door.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim charges her power, then places her hand on the scanner.  When this is done, the wheel overhead turns allowing the sliding door to open.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door opens and bings like an elevator.  The manager welcomes Kim and Ron to the Go Tower.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager begins telling Kim and Ron that he is not an ordinary fast food manager.  Ron begins blaming the manager for trying to kill the naco.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has realized that the manager is really a super hero.  But she somehow got his super strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The manager rips his Bueno Nacho manager uniform and reveals himself as the super hero earlier in the episode.  He announces himself as Hego.  The ripping of his shirt is similar to the way Superman takes off his clothes to reveal his super costume.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is about to bring up the naco again, but Kim won’t let him.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim hears the name Hego, then sees a green chair.  Kim asks if Hego knows Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego indicates that Shego is his sister.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders what Shego’s last name is.  It has been theorized, but never confirmed, that Team Go were all given aliases when they became super heroes.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Shego now works for Dr. Drakken.  Hego has never heard of Drakken.  Kim indicates she’s never heard of Aviarius.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wants to talk about Shego some more.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego pushes a circular button on the table.  This causes a holographic picture of Team go to appear over the table displayed by a projector in the center.  Hego indicates that they all fought evil as a family.  But Shego enjoyed being evil, so she left.  Team Go was never the same, and they broke up.  It is revealed in Season 4 that Shego kept everyone focused and the team together.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wants to know how Team Go got their powers.  Hego pushes two rectangle buttons on the table in front of him.  There are six buttons total.  Hego pushes number 2 and number 4.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The display changes.  Hego indicates that a rainbow colored meteorite gave them special powers when they were children.  The display shows the rainbow colored meteorite destroying the clubhouse.  They were most likely inside when it was destroyed.  The display is most likely a recreation of the events.  It is highly unlikely that a camera was set up to watch a meteorite destroy a clubhouse with children inside when it crashed to the earth.  Although not confirmed, it has been theorized that Team Go’s parents were killed when the meteorite crashed, and the government took over their lives to turn them into super heroes.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim didn’t get a good look at the multicolored meteorite.  Hego backs the video up by pushing button number 4.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego offers Kim his seat since he lost his super strength and it now belongs to Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron takes Hego’s seat and begins to relax.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus relaxes in the purple chair.  This really annoys Hego.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests they find Aviarius, get his power draining staff, and get the power switched so Hego can have his super strength back.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>At Ron’s request, Kim lifts the table using her super strength with only one hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wants Kim to keep the super strength.  Hego says, “Those powers are a great responsibility.”  This is a play on the famous line from Spiderman, “With great power comes great responsibility.”<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Mego.  The monitor shows Mego outside knocking on the door.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego pushes a small red button to let Mego in.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego chastises Mego for not using his Go Team glow to get in.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego argues that he doesn’t have the Team Go glow anymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assumes that Aviarius stole Mego’s super power.  Mego indicates this is correct, then wonders who he is talking to.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders what Mego’s super power was, and asks if he did fire.  Mego indicates he didn’t do fire.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to connect the color purple to a super power.  Ron then assumes that Mego did some sort of bruising.  Mego indicates this is incorrect too.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego indicates that Mego can shrink his size.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sarcastically makes fun of Mego’s super power.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego indicates that his shrinking super power is very useful.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego sits down in his chair; currently occupied by Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego tells Rufus to get out of his chair.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus does so, but complains about it.  Mego tells Rufus to be quiet.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego indicates he feels empty without his powers.  Hego tries to console him by telling him he lost his super powers too.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego doesn’t care that Hego lost his powers.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests they focus on where Aviarius will strike next.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego and Mego realize at the same time that Aviarius will try to get their twin brothers to drain their powers next.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius suddenly shows up on the monitor.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Wego and Wego.  Like Kim, Shego has twin brothers.  Aviarius drains their powers.  Wego and Wego say the classic line from nearly all super hero comic books and movies, “You’ll never get away with this!”<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wego and Wego are suddenly distracted by seeing the Go Tower, Hego, and Mego.  This indicates that Aviarius has a camera somewhere in the Go Tower, and uses a monitor to display what is happening.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Aviarius demands they surrender Kim or else the twins will be harmed.<br/><br/>FADE TO BLACK -- COMMERCIAL BREAK<br/>

<img src="images/go_team_go/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks where Aviarius’ lair is.  Aviarius’ lair is displayed on a monitor.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron assumes correctly that Aviarius calls his lair, “The Nest.”  Ron  begins seeing Aviarius as a lame super villain.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks if The Nest is in the Himalayas.  Hego indicates that The Nest is on top of Go Mountain at the edge of Go City.  Hego indicates he doesn’t like long distance relationships with his foes.  This is a play on relationships regarding love, which are complicated when two people in love live so far away from each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks how they defeated Aviarius in the past.  Hego indicates they did it with teamwork.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Hego calls this teamwork, “Go-Operation.”<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron begins seeing Team Go as lame super heroes, and now sees why Shego left.  Kim seems to agree with this statement.  Kim indicates they need Shego’s help.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego reads the magazine “Villain’s Digest.”  It is an older issue of the magazine. The same picture from Two To Tutor is on the cover.  This is the magazine that had a help wanted ad leading Shego to be hired by Senior Senior Senior to tutor Junior.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego pretends to listen while Drakken indicates that Shego stole a mutation agent.  <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s lair rumbles like an earthquake just hit it.

Drakken runs and hides behind a sliding metal door.  Drakken peeks out and mentions that he feels he and Shego are like family.

She sees Rufus is attacking her.  Rufus seems to have tapped his mystical monkey power to attack Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/281.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego tries to stomp Rufus.

The mech may have been inspired by Omega Supreme from The Transformers.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/294.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that Wade contacted him and said Shego was in trouble.  Drakken doesn’t know Wade’s name.

Ron retorts that Drakken knows who is he.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/296.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates he can’t remember Ron’s name, but does remember him so that Ron can’t be Aviarius.

This annoys Aviarius because Hego always says this when Aviarius is captured.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/307.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Later, at Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho, Hego explains why the naco isn’t on the menu.  Hego explains that the naco didn’t test well with ten randomly selected customers.  The Mexi mushroom wrap was a big hit.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/308.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron decides that wraps are not going to be the future of Bueno Nacho.  Ron indicates he is going to talk to someone about it.  This indicates that Ron has connections with the Bueno Nacho corporation, which is understandable since he invented the naco and it was picked up by the Bueno Nacho corporation.  This is the second time Ron would help Bueno Nacho, leading Ron to help make him a multi-millionaire in the future episode Ron Millionaire.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/309.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Meanwhile, Mego tells Wego and Wego that they should have never quit being superheroes.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/310.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Like Jim and Tim, Wego and Wego are psychically connected to finish each other’s sentences.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/311.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mego indicates they should get a new team leader.  Mego will most likely nominate himself for the role of leader.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/312.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim talks to Wade.  Wade wonders if Shego would have used all of Team Go’s for evil.  Kim reminds Wade that Shego is evil.  But then she ponders this as she remembers how easy it was to get the staff away from Shego.  Shego may have allowed the staff to be taken from her to give the super hero powers back to her brothers, and still show the intention of being evil.  The Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho doesn’t appear to have any customers.  It is most likely closed.  Being a manager, Hego would have a key and access to Mucho Grande Bueno Nacho. <br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/313.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s giant mech flies around Go City at night.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/314.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that he believes Shego allowed the staff to be taken from her so she could give her brothers back their powers but still appear evil.  Drakken calls Shego a softie.<br/><br/><img src="images/go_team_go/315.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego makes Drakken hang on to the rockets on the bottom of the robot’s feet as it flies.  The rockets somehow have a propulsion, but do not get hot.  Otherwise, Drakken would either have to let go, or would have been burned to a crisp.  Drakken quickly changes his mind about Shego being a softie.<br/><br/>FADE TO BLACK -- END CREDITS.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: There are a lot of unanswered questions involving Shego and Team Go.  What are Team Go’s real names?  Is Go really their last name?  How old was Shego when the meteorite hit?  What is in Shego’s leg pouch?  All of these questions have been purposely left unanswered to make Shego the mysterious woman that she is.  What has been confirmed is the birth order of Team Go: First Hego, then Mego, then Shego, then Wego and Wego.  Wego and Wego are the same age as Kim and Ron.  Speculation suggests Shego’s real name is Sheila.  When brought up on message boards, the topic of a spin off series involving the early years of Team Go was highly approved by fans. <br/>
