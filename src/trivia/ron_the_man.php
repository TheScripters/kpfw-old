Drakken wonders if Dementor is threatening the world with his pan dimensional vortex inducer.  <br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates that Dementor and his henchmen are relaxing by the pool.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>As indicated by Shego, Dementor and his henchmen are relaxing by the pool.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/246.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tries to be sneaky as he spies on Dementor.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is annoyed by the idea that Dementor finds time to relax.<br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor is on a pool floatation device.  His drink has an umbrella and a straw.  It is most likely non-alcoholic since Dementor has his wits about him later in the episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tries to open the gate by pulling on it.  It doesn’t budge.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A towel boy walks by and tells Drakken that the pool is for hotel guests only.  He will need a hotel key to get in. The towel boy looks a lot like one of the waiters from The Billionaire’s Club.  While he has the same hair style and body build, he did not work at The Billionaire’s Club.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates he’ll check into the hotel, then steal the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego and Drakken’s henchmen wait in the lobby while Drakken tries to check in.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Jilly from New Jersey.  Drakken asks him for a hotel room.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jilly apologizes and indicates that no rooms are available due to a convention.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken then demands a key to the hotel pool.  Jilly refuses to give it to him because the pool is only for registered guests.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken grabs Jilly.  He calls him, “You annoying little poser!”  Jilly demands Drakken let go of his suit.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken walks away angrily and calls to Shego.  Shego doesn’t do anything; most likely because Kim shows up a few seconds later.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jilly straightens his tie and then greets Kim who somehow missed Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim shows Jilly a picture of Drakken from her kimmunicator.  She asks him if he has seen him.  Jilly indicates he has.  A jackpot sound is heard in the background indicating that there is gambling at the hotel.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim can’t reach the lever to the door of the pool area where Dementor is.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wants Rufus to slip through the gate and unlock the door.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he could bend the bars.  Kim scratches this idea.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus opens the door by leaping from the top of the gate and landing on the hatch.  He then hangs on as the door opens.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Rufus spy on everyone at the pool by hiding behind a newspaper.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim notices Drakken, Shego, and his henchmen at the top of the hotel.  She also notices Drakken’s henchmen are wearing the molecular muscle enhancers.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor notices Drakken’s henchmen scaling down the hotel.  Drakken and Shego soon follow right behind them.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor snaps his fingers.  His henchmen appear out of the hotel windows.  They cut the lines with knives.  The knives are super sharp.  They cut the rope with just one slash.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken, Shego, and his henchmen fall into the pool.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor taunts Drakken with the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron haven’t heard of the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  Ron wonders what the connection is between it and the rings.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken says, “Use the power of the rings!”  This may be a reference to Lord Of The Rings.  Drakken demands his henchmen get the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron get the connection between the rings and the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  It is now revealed that Ron was using a potted plant to hide behind, but is obviously too big now.  Kim is sitting in a pool lounge chair.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands Shego do a thorough search of the hotel.  Shego indicates she’ll start by searching the buffet table.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Much to Shego’s dismay, Drakken indicates he search the buffet table.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken walks away with his shoes squishing.  This indicates he is still wet from the pool.  Shego slumps in annoyance.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This background character is holding a drinking cup.  It is most likely a cold drink since it is the Las Vegas desert.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron appear over the starlight lounge of the hotel.  <br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The star and font is silimar to the famous Welcome to Las Vegas Nevada sign.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim contacts Wade and asks him about Professor Dementor.  Wade indicates Dementor stole the pan dimensional vortex inducer from a research facility in the rocky mountains a few days ago.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is annoyed she wasn’t contacted sooner.  Wade indicates the local, federal, and international law enforcement are on the case.  They though that Kim’s help wasn’t necessary.  Kim displays her self absorbed confidence by saying, “Well, I guess they thought wrong.”<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron jump down.  Ron decides to check out a room on the side of the hotel.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron rips the doors off the hinges.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron interrupts a conference of some sort.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is embarrassed.  She pulls Ron away.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees Dementor going up an escalator.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron notices Drakken.

Ron charges into them.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/185.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jilly notices the disturbance and sees Ron flying backwards.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron lands upside down in the conference room.  He is approached by Rabbi Katz.  He calls Ron, “Ronald.”<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks Rabbi Katz what he is doing here.  Rabbi Katz indicates he is present for a rabbinical conference.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rabbi Katz asks Ron if he has been working out.  Ron shows off his muscles.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/189.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Rabbi Katz that his bar mitzvah certifiicate isn’t signed.  Rabbi Katz indicates he’ll sign it as soon as he gets back to Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/190.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Rabbi Katz that signing the bar mitzvah certificate is no longer necessary.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/191.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rabbi Katz agrees.  Rabbi Katz indicates the bar mitzvah is what really counts.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates what really counts are his muscles.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rabbi Katz is about to talk to Ron when they are distracted by Drakken’s henchmen.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron picks Rabbi Katz up and places him to the side.  Ron indicates he’s going to take care of some business.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jilly notices another disturbance in the hotel.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor gets to the second floor.  He can’t decide if he wants to have the buffet, or see a show.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego get to the second floor by elevator.  <br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  Dementor refuses to give it up.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tries to introduce Dementor to his improved henchmen.  But they’re missing.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor demands his henchmen get Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates that they’re surrounded by six henchmen.  Drakken indicates he can’t fight them.  Some have analyzed Drakken and Shego as counterparts to Kim and Ron.  This scene illustrates this very well.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim isn’t sure whether or not Ron has Drakken’s henchmen under control.  Ron says, “Yo!”  This may be a borrowed expression from Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees one of Dementor’s henchmen go flying.  Kim hopes that Ron’s new muscles can handle the situation.  Ron assures her he can.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego throws all of Dementor’s henchmen into the elevator.  The door closes.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Dementor fight over the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor slips and falls from a cigarette ashtray bin.  The pan dimensional vortex inducer slips from his hand.  It lands on the ledge.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim uses her grappling hook and catches the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  She swings up to the second floor.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego grabs the pan dimensional vortex inducer from Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego fight.  Shego can only fight with one hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim kicks the pan dimensional vortex inducer from Shego’s hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/211.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The pan dimensional vortex inducer bounces on the floor a bit before it is picked up Drakken.  Drakken thanks Kim.  The pan dimensional vortex inducer suddenly emits a high frequency sound and lights up with red.  It then begins beeping.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/212.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken asks what the beeping sound is.  Dementor indicates that the pan dimensional vortex inducer has been activated.  Drakken then asks if that is a bad thing.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego are both annoyed by Drakken’s ignorance.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/214.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor asks Drakken if he even knows what the pan dimensional vortex inducer does.  Drakken assumes that it is very dangerous.  He concludes it is the only explanation for being top secret.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/215.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor indicates that the vortex it creates will be contained disruption in the very fabric of reality.  Space, time, and energy will all be twisted in a vortex of pure chaos.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/216.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken panics.  He suddenly gets the strength to pull a ventilation grate from the ventilation shaft, even though it was screwed on.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/217.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken then throws the pan dimensional vortex inducer into the ventilation shaft.  <br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tries to put the grate back on.  But since the screws are now broke, it falls to the floor.  Drakken and Dementor try running away.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dementor indicates that the vortex created will be the size of Nevada.  There is no possible way for them to escape.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego both try to get the pan dimensional vortex inducer at the same time.  Shego is most likely tryng to save herself rather than the world.  Kim may be trying to keep Shego from getting the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  However, Kim’s self absorbed confidence keeps either one of them from getting the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The pan dimensional vortex inducer is sitting near the edge of the ventilation shaft.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/222.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The pan dimensional vortex inducer falls and rolls on it’s side.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/223.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pulls Kim and Shego out of the ventilation shaft.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron drops Kim and Shego, and prepares to do what he calls, “man’s work.”  He gets inside the ventilation shaft, and gets stuck.  He can’t reach the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/225.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego makes fun of Ron for being big and stupid looking.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/226.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron remembers Mr. Barkin saying that the ideal man is big and or strong.  This makes Ron try harder to get the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  He still can’t reach it.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/227.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hears Rabbi Katz telling Ron there was nothing wrong with the way he was.  Ron then hears Kim telling him that he doesn’t need instant muscles.  <br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/228.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron begins to crack thinking there are too many voices in his head.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/229.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assures Ron that the voices he is hearing are real from outside of the venilation shaft.  Rabbi Katz tells Ron that being a man is not all about having muscles.  Kim tells Ron to take off the ring.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/230.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron refuses to take off the ring.  He tries even harder to get to the pan dimensional vortex inducer.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/231.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The pan dimensional vortex inducer wobbles on it’s side, nearly going off the edge.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/232.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands Ron take off the ring.  Ron tries, but his arm is stuck.  He can’t reach the ring.  When he tells Kim he can’t take off the ring, Kim thinks he is unwilling to.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/233.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus squeezes through and takes off the ring for Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/234.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron goes back to normal.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/235.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego watch as Ron crawls into the ventilation shaft.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/236.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron catches the pan dimensional vortex inducer just as it rolls off the edge.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/237.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Annoyed by the beeping, Ron smacks the pan dimensional vortex inducer on it’s side.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/238.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It is a Ron Factor moment.  The pan dimensional vortex inducer lights up green and is deactivated.<br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/247.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hopes that it’s okay that he deactivated the pan dimensional vortex inducer.  Obviously Ron didn’t realize it’s dangerous potential.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/239.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken grabs the pan dimensional vortex inducer just as Ron comes out of the ventilation shaft.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/240.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus wears the molecular muscle enhancer and grabs Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/241.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rabbi Katz signs Ron’s bar mitzvah certificate at his house in Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/ron_the_man/242.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets a kiss on the cheek from his mother as she celebrates Ron’s new manhood.  His father congratulates him.  This episode has brought up two subjects constantly on the message boards.  The first is why Ron eats non-kosher foods even though he is Jewish.  The second is the speculation of whether or not Kim and Ron will have a Jewish wedding.<br/>
