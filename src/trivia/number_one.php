<br>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see the Mad Dog pyramid. We also find out what the mascot for Middleton High is. There is another unknown cheerleader girl standing to the left of the pyramid. Tara and Jessica are now present. Marcella might be the girl standing in front of the pyramid, but it's not confirmed.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates she has time for anybody on the squad.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie tells Kim she looks tired. Kim indicates she did fly in from Abu Dhabi. She had a mission where she rescued an ambassador.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/4.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Bonnie argue over who is giving more to the squad. Bonnie thinks Kim should give a hundred ten percent. Kim says she gives a hundred twenty percent. Bonnie then says that she can give the squad a hundred thirty percent.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's temper flares when she realizes Bonnie wants to be cheer captain. First indication that Kim is the cheer captain.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/6.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie calls Kim, ''Little Miss Smugmug.'' She then promises she will be cheer captain.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/7.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron seems to think that Bueno Nacho is cutting back on the beans.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/8.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron uses Rufus for analysis on the burrito. He wants a cheese/bean ratio.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/9.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron has been hearing all about Kim's Bonnie problem for awhile now. He's able to quote Kim without problem.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/10.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Rufus eats Bueno Nacho food, then falls asleep.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/11.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim doesn't think Bonnie has a chance to become cheer captain. Ron advises Kim to watch out for Bonnie, and says that she can be tricky. This is the first indication about Kim having too much confidence in herself and taking others for granted.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/12.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Global Justice uses a trap door to capture Kim.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/13.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim suddenly finds herself in a glass cylinder.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/14.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Correction: The cylinders must be plastic. They can bend at angles. Multiple tubes all seem to lead down.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/15.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Despite being plastic, they are heat resistant. The amount of friction by air to ignite fire on something is incredible.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/16.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>There are four tubes altogether. Kim was in the second tube from the left.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/17.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim pounds on the door but does not open. Then it opens automatically. It must computer or remote controlled.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/18.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim is disorientated. She looks around wondering where she is, but fails to notice somebody coming towards her.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/19.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Dr. Director's first appearance. Dr. Director was modeled after Marvel's Nick Fury. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/20.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Dr. Director welcomes Kim to the Global Justice Network. It's acronym is GJ.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/21.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Agent Will Du's first appearance. He arrives in the first tube on the left.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/22.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Dr. Director indicates Will Du is Global Justice's number one agent. Kim doesn't seem to like him from the moment they meet.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/23.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A picture of Professor Syvan Green. In the 1960's, he developed a top secret missile defense project. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/24.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim knows the name of that project. It was called the serenita guided missile tracking system. Kim got the information off the web.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/25.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A current picture of Sylvan Green. He's retired and living in Florida.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/26.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim guesses that Sylvan Green was kidnapped. She is right.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/27.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Dr. Director asks Kim to help Agent Will Du find Professor Green.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/28.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du can speak fourteen languages and thirty-two regional dialects.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/29.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim is taking French. We never hear her say anything French. Ron does in a later episode, indicating that he was taking French too.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/30.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim begins telling Dr. Director about her Bonnie problem. Agent Will Du interrupts and says it is an insult to work with Kim. He calls Kim an amateur. Kim's overconfidence overwhelms her, and tells them that she's in.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/31.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>MHS sign</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/32.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that Bonnie didn't show up for cheer practice.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/33.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du shows up at Middleton High. Kim refuses to assist him in his investigation. Instead she insists she works as an equal.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/34.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After greeting Will Du, Ron gets shocked.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/35.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du indicates that he uses a stopwatch that causes temporary paralysis. It's standard procedure for anybody who comes within one meter.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/36.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du's watch also works as a voice recorder. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/37.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du's watch also shocked Rufus. Will Du calls Rufus, ''a hairless rodent.'' Kim corrects him, and calls Will Du, ''Mr. I Know Everything.'' Will Du puts the correct Latin name for naked mole rat (hydrocephalus glabor) in his voice recording watch. This indication shows Will Du can also speak Latin. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/38.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron gets back up and greet Will Du again. Will Du jumps away and gets into a fighting stance. This indicates that Will Du also knows martial arts.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/39.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron gets into a martial arts position too. Although his martial arts skill at this point is very limited.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/40.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>In this scene, Bonnie calls Kim, ''K.'' Kim calls Bonnie, ''B.'' This could be construed that Kim is calling Bonnie a pregnant dog.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/41.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie missed cheer practice because she was launching a new fundraiser selling chocolates.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/42.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie plans on selling a whole truckload of chocolates.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/43.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron is taking Bonnie very seriously. Again, Kim overestimates Bonnie's abilities.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/44.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron proclaims himself a natural born seller with the gift of gab.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/45.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron's first intended customer is Will Du. Ron indicates that each chocolate bar is 1.9 ounces. We'll see Ron's lack of selling skills again in Bonding.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/46.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The flavors mentioned in this scene: plain, crispy, peanut, and macadamia.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/47.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron gives up. Will Du buys a bar from Rufus.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/52.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A close-up of the one dollar bill. There is no face on the bill.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/48.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron believes that Rufus's selling ability comes from being naked. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/49.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see the Possible home at sunset.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/50.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du indirectly knows Mrs. Possible. He read her recent paper on the application of lasers in sub-cranial exploration. He also notes the picture of her didn't do her justice.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/51.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>This flatters Mrs. Possible who wants Kim to invite Will Du over more often.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/53.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The kimmunicator creates a 3D holographic simulation of Professor Green's home.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/54.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus goes into the 3D home and tries to sit on the furniture. It vaporizes.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/55.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du indicates he already examined the crime scene.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/164.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Whoever broke into Professor Green's home did so with an explosive method of entry.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/56.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade runs an extrapolation routine to find this clue. It is actually a golf ball.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/57.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade indicates that Professor Green showed on many online discussion groups about gardening, botany, and experimental fertilizers. His lawn won the blue-grass ribbon three years in a row.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/58.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du is convinced that Professor Green was kidnapped for his weapon system expertise.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/59.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim reminds Will Du that Professor Green was a weapons expert in the 1960's. You can look up what Professor Green knows in any library.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/60.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du calls Kim, ''an amateur'' and a waste of his time.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/61.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates she found another trace element: hyperactic acid. It is an experimental fertilizer found only on the black market. Notice she winks at Ron when she says this. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/62.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron suggests they visit the world headquarters for black market supplies for gardening. But he doesn't know where that is.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/63.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Though it's not confirmed, it looks as though Kim went to Turkey.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/64.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Big Daddy Brotherson.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/65.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du pushes Ron out of the way and once again calls them, ''amateurs.''</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/66.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Indication that Big Daddy Brotherson likes to play games.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/67.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Big Daddy suggests a game called, ''Thud.'' He claps his hands summoning his bodyguard.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/68.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Big Daddy's bodyguard.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/69.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du is thrown out the window. And lands with a thud!</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/70.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Big Daddy loves to play Thud!</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/71.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>There is only one rule in the black market establishment: Client confidentiality.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/72.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Client confidentiality is easily broken by a milk chocolate with chewy nugget bar. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/73.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Will Du wait outside for Kim. It seems Will Du's watch really does keep time.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/74.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim reveals the identity of the new bad guy: Duff Killigan.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/75.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du carries a GJ mobile database. It's standard issued for all top agents.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/76.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Duff Killigan: Born in Scotland. He's a former professional golfer. He is banned from every golf course in the world, even miniature golf for excessive displays of temper. Weapon of choice: Exploding golf balls. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Will Du are too busy to notice the silhouette. Ron does notice, and tries to get their attention.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/78.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Duff Killigan.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/79.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A close-up of Killigan's exploding golf balls.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/80.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron grabs Kim and Will Du and drags them away to safety. Killigan's golf ball explodes seconds later.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/81.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron checks on Rufus. He is happily eating a chocolate bar. Ron tells Rufus he'll have to pay for the chocolate. Perhaps Ron gives Rufus an allowance.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/82.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie sold a whole truckload of chocolate. Bonnie is wearing a new uniform that she got from the proceeds. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/83.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we hear the word, ''Badical.'' The whole team got new uniforms.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/84.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie is also working on a new cheer.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/85.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim is so suspicious of Bonnie, she thinks Bonnie is getting outside help.</p>
<a name="act2"></a>


<img src="images/number_one_trivia/86.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Will Du wait for Kim at Bueno Nacho.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/87.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tries to impress Will Du by showing him a trick. It involves squeezing a burrito till the contents fly up in the air. Ron catches the contents in his mouth. Then he swallows it.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/88.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du is not impressed with Ron's trick.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/89.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus does it too. But with a nacho and cheese.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/90.jpg" border="0" alt=""><img src="images/number_one_trivia/91.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Out of curiosity, Ron asks Will Du if he does ''normal stuff, like go to school.'' Will Du indicates he is ''tutored by the world''s greatest minds.'' </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/92.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron thinks that by ''tutored,'' Will Du needs special help. Ron indicates that he needed help with math in his freshman year. First indication of Ron lacking math skills.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/93.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron has the kimmunicator while Kim is at cheer practice.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/94.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim in her new cheer outfit.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/95.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After showing Kim the new cheer, Bonnie indicates it is what giving the team a hundred fifty percent is like.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/96.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim sarcastically warns Bonnie that giving a hundred sixty percent causes spontaneous combustion.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/97.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim jacks Ron's shirt when angry to drag him away. We see this again in Emotion Sickness.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/98.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim tells Ron her suspicion that Bonnie is getting outside help.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/99.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The GJ hoverjet. It's standard issued for all top agents.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/100.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It's also controlled by remote. It makes the same sound as a car alarm being set.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/101.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du offers ''ladies first.'' Ron goes in first.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/102.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/103.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan lives on an island with a castle and a full golf course.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/104.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan must not get many visitors. The front door is wide open.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/105.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Will Du argue over whether Professor Green was kidnapped for his weapons expertise, or his ability to grow lawns.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/106.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron points the way to the dungeon.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/107.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan kidnapped Professor Green and found out that he used experimental hyperactic acid to grow super grass.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/108.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan has a dog. It appears to be a Scottish terrier, but it's not confirmed. This is the only time we see Killigan's dog.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/109.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Green is being held with super grass.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron uses Rufus as electrical clippers to set Professor Green free.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/111.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Green's first appearance. He indicates that Killigan trapped him in his own super grass.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/112.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Green confirms that he was kidnapped for his super grass; not his weapons expertise.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/113.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim lays out Killigan's plan. He is going to cover the world with super grass to make it his own personal golf course.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/114.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Kim's laser pen. It's looks like a miniature light saber from Star Wars.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/115.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du rushes into the room where Killigan is, and is easily tripped. He obviously has less fighting skill than Kim or Killigan.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/116.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/117.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan hits each ball one at a time. Kim is attacked by multiple projectiles. The balls must split halves or even thirds after being hit. Kim dodges them by jumping onto a ceiling fixture.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/118.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan manages to hit the balls backwards, hitting Will Du and knocking him out.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/119.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Duff Killigan's family coat of arms.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/120.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim twirls Killigan's golf clubs.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/121.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan can twirl his golf clubs too.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/122.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Killigan engage in battle, using the golf clubs as weapons. Kim breaks the first set. She knocks the second set out of Killigan's hands.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/123.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan turns the knob on his fireplace. It operates a trap door for his escape.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/124.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron stays out of the action, petting his naked mole rat.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/125.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see Killigan's blimp.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/126.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan has island booby trapped with quicksand pits.</p>
<a name="act3"></a>




<img src="images/number_one_trivia/127.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron uses his negotiation skills to get Kim and Will Du to work together. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/128.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<P>Kim suggests help with the hoverjet. Will Du says he left the remote command module (or R.C.M.) in the hoverjet.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/129.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus won't sink in the quicksand. Rufus has to get the R.C.M.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/130.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du is impressed with Kim, even though she still an ''amateur.''</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/131.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The R.C.M. was left on the sun visor of the hoverjet.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/132.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<P>Ron enjoys being in the quicksand. He says it feels nice.<p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/133.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du catches the R.C.M. in his teeth. It lights up when he activates it.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/134.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The hoverjet drops a rope. Kim goes before anyone else because ''Ladies first.'' Kim grabs it with her teeth. </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/135.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The rope goes up as soon as Kim grabs it. It must have a sensor that automatically recoils when somebody puts pressure on it.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/136.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du wonders why Kim annoys him. Ron explains that Will Du is very ''irkable'' </p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/137.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Will Du was about to ask Professor Green something. Kim demands he pays attention to his flying. Unfortunately, nobody is wearing their seatbelt in this scene.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/138.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Green indicates that Killigan plans to attack the first country that banned him from a golf course. That country is Japan. Japan is where Kim and Ron have had a large majority of missions. Professor Green disappears after this scene. He must have been dropped off somewhere safe.
</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/139.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Green's super grass grows in a few seconds, and can cover a few acres.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/140.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Killigan attacks Kim with the super grass. Kim dodges it. It then covers the hoverjet.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/141.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Will Du escape by hitting the eject button located on the console of the hoverjet.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/142.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/143.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron lands on Will Du. Ron catches Rufus.</p>
<img src="images/number_one_trivia/144.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
