Show notes: Most episodes of Kim Possible can be viewed individually, without losing too much storyline.  This is not the case when it comes to Ron and his mystical monkey powers.  These episodes have to be viewed in a certain order.  These are Monkey Fist Strikes, Monkey Ninjas In Space, Exchange, and Gorilla Fist.  This episode introduces Monkey Fist and Cousin Larry.<br/><br/><img src="images/monkey_fist_strikes/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is mountain climbing and has the kimmunicator attached to her wrist.
