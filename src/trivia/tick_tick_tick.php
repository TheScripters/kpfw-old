<p>Show notes: This episode introduces Shego and Drakken.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The first thing we see is Middleton High and the ever-changing sign.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G25.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G26.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Many of these students appear often in the background throughout the series.<p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G27.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim's first appearance.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G28.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim opens her locker by turning the knob three times to the right.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G29.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Notice that the wanted posters for Drakken and Shego are missing. Kim's computer uses a zip drive system. The monitor remains turned off in this scene. Kim is trying to print a term paper.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/7.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim operates the printer with the push of a single button.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G30.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron's first appearance.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G31.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron wear these outfits for most of the series.  It wasn't until Season 2 that their wardrobe was expanded on.  This was due to message boards asking if Kim had more fashion sense to wear different clothes.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G32.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron downloaded cheat codes for Steel Toe Cyber Slam so he could beat the boss of level six.  This is the first mention of two of Ron's favorite hobbies: Video games and wrestling.  Ron also says his full name here.  Kim's full name is revealed later.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/10.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates her term paper is about history.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G33.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A naked mole rat named Rufus lives in Ron's pocket.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G34.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Rufus. Before Kim Possible, Bob and Mark had thought of a show involving a naked mole rat. The show was never created. With Kim Possible, Disney executives wanted a pet on the show. Bob and Mark chose the naked mole rat because they're funny looking, ugly, and fascinate children at the zoo. Nancy Cartwright, best known as the voice of Bart Simpson, did the voice of Rufus to do something different.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G35.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron tells Kim Rufus can program a VCR.  This is the first time Rufus shows off his mechanical skills.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G36.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus throws four things out of the printer.  The first is a pencil.  Then an eraser.  Then a bobby pin.  The fourth thing appears to be a paper clip, but the animation is incomplete.</P>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/17.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim calls Rufus, ''the hairless freak.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/18.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim writes the standard term paper. It has the paper, the notes, and the bibliography.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G37.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A possible reference to Season 1 director, Chris Bailey.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G38.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Mr. Barkin.  The role of Mr. Barkin was written for Patrick Warburton, who worked with Bob and Mark previously on Buzz Lightyear.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G39.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Late for class again!  Kim is tardy three times in one month.</p>

<img src="images/tick_trivia/G48.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G47.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>How to tell the difference between Jim and Tim: Jim wears green.  Tim wears red and his hair has a few more spikes than Jim.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G49.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Mr. Possible is reading ''The Examiner'' newspaper.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G50.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. Possible indicates there is a launch pad in the back yard.  Mr. Possible was designed after Mr. Fantastic from The Fantastic Four.</P>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G51.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Mrs. Possible were both redesigned in Season 1 to make it easier to animate. Kim indicates that her mom is a brain surgeon, and her father is a rocket scientist.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/33.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim tells her parents she got detention. Mr. Possible indicates that a Possible has never gotten detention, except Jim and Tim. Mr. Possible then refers them as ''little monkeys.'' Jim and Tim can be seen in the background firing off a rocket. This is the first time we see them do something with rocket technology.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G53.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Kim says, ''no big.''</P>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/35.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>im refers Mr. Barkin as, ''Mr. three strikes Barkin.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G54.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim feels that as a cheerleader, she shouldn't have detention.  Mr. Possible refers Mr. Barkin as ''tough, but fair.''</P>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/37.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that a cheerleader, she shouldn't do detention.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/38.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that other kids do detention. The ones who, ''break the rules.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/40.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim says, ''Do I have the right to remain silent?'' A reference to the Miranda rights, which is read to suspected criminals when they are arrested.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G55.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The kimmunicator goes off.  Mrs. Possible thinks it's the hospital.  Mr. Possible thinks it's the propulsion lab.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G56.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of the kimmunicator.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G57.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade's first appearance. He tells Kim that she got a hit on her website from the Amazon. First indication that Wade runs Kim's website, and that she does global missions from around the world. This is when we find out Kim gets her missions with hits onto her website. Kim's mission takes place in the Amazon of South America.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G58.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>When Wade goes off, the kimmunicator displays the KP logo.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G59.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Possible are reluctant to let Kim go on a mission on a school night, till Kim does her puppy-dog pout.  It has never been explored how Ron's parents feel about him going on missions around the world.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G60.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim can go on the mission, after she finishes her peas. </p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/48.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim refers them as ''tough, but fair.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/49.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron arrive at this mission by seaplane.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G61.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Gustavo.   Kim saved his village from a flood last year.  This shows how Kim gets rides to different parts of the globe: by helping others.  It is never explained how Kim can get from one area of the world to another in such a short period of time.  Kim equates the rescue to swim practice, although we never see Kim swimming at high school.  First time we see Kim wearing mission clothes.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G62.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego's first appearance.  It's obvious Shego is athletically gifted and good martial artist.  We also see the kimmunicator can do streaming video.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G63.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we Ron in mission clothes.  Ron is drinking from a Bueno Nacho cup.  Ron indicates Bueno Nacho gives free refills.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G64.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron and Rufus often share Bueno Nacho food throughout the series.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G65.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>This scene shows Ron as the incapable goofy sidekick.  This will change over time.  Test markets didn't like Ron, and wondered why a confident girl like Kim would have such an incompetent sidekick.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G66.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>In Season 1, Rufus' eyes became big and human-like when surprised.  This changed with Season 2.  His eyes remained small and beady.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G67.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Icari's first appearance. Professor Icari studies entomology.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G68.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Icari's centipede is named Links.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G69.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see what will be later known as ''The Ron Factor.'' </p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G70.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G71.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G72.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron's first flashback to Camp Wannaweep and the horror events of Cabin 13.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G73.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Professor Icari explains a disc was stolen.  It contained blueprints for a robot tick that was identical to the real thing.  When asked why, he explains he has a lot of time on his hands.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/62.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Drakken's main lair.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G74.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken often uses trap doors and elevator shafts throughout the series.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G75.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego lands with her hair messed up.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G76.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Dr. Drakken's first appearance.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G77.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Many things about Drakken annoy Shego.  In this case, it is his singing.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G78.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>MHS sign.  Detention is held in room 12.  This is the only time Middleton looks gloomy.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G79.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego is wanted in eleven countries.  The number on the plate is 11734.  Like Patrick Warburton, Nicole Sullivan was written especially for Shego.  She worked with Bob and Mark before on Buzz Lightyear.  An early script for Tick Tick Tick originally said Shego was eighteen.  Steve confirmed that Shego was in her early twenties.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G80.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron had a short term crush on Shego for awhile.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G81.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. Barkin uses military time.Detention starts at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G82.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First indication that Mr. Barkin and Ron are really at odds.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G83.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron advises Kim, ''Chocolate's as good as cash, and don't look anyone in the eyes.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G85.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. Barkin sits backwards in the chair.  The detention room is dark and gloomy, with shadows that represent a prison.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G84.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Vinnie and Big Mike.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G86.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Junior's first appearance.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G87.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The detention clock is busted.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G88.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>In Season 1, Kim's hair was flippy.  It sometimes moved in front of her.  In Season 2, her hair would stay behind her.</p>
<a name="act2"></a>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G89.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Junior has never been so close to a cheerleader.  He notes Kim's skin is flawless, and compares it to baby's bottom.  This freaks Kim out.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G90.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The book Mr. Barkin is reading is called ''Infiltration And Deception Manual.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G91.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus freaks everyone out; especially Big Mike.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G92.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. Barkin tries to hurt Rufus with a yardstick.  It has no numbers on it.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G93.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus runs up Vinnie's pants leg for safety.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G94.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It doesn't work.  Mr. Barkin tries to hit Rufus anyways.  There are a few places where you can see Big Mike's face before he reveals himself at the end.  This is one of them.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G95.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The plan is revealed.  Ron uses Rufus to help bust Kim out of detention.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G96.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Mr. Barkin thinks Rufus is a genetic mutation experiment that busted out of the science lab.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G97.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bueno Nacho's first appearance.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G98.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron's usual seat.  It's remained unchanged throughout the series.  Kim and Ron don't actually eat any Bueno Nacho food in this episode.  They only have drinks.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G99.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim refers detention as ''a meeting of the lifetime losers club.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/G100.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron agrees.  The he realizes that he's served detention before.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade scanned air traffic record and found a small jet of suspicious orgin.  The jet went to a private island in the Caribbean.  This is the location for Drakken's main lair.  It is also said to be haunted.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The first word we can hear Rufus plainly say is, ''Haunted?!''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>''Keep out meddling kids.''  A reference to Scooby-Doo.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H4.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Wade tells Kim to check her backpack.  It's never clear how Wade gets new gadgets in there without being seen.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>''Gravy!''  A reference to Ed, Edd, and Eddy.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H6.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>It looks like lipstick.  But it's actually an elastic constricting agent.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H7.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim found her compact.  She must have lost it for awhile.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H8.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Kim says, ''Let's jet.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H9.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A close-up of Drakken's robotic tick.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H10.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The robotic tick is made with nano-technology.  It's so small that Drakken has to construct it suing a microscope.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H11.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The intruder alert is the same as the old Star Trek red alert.  It's so loud , that Drakken and Shego can't talk to each other.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H12.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim swims like a pro scuba diver.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H13.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron swims more like a frog.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H14.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Rufus uses an airtight ball.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H15.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken captures Kim and Ron with a water vortex of some sort.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H16.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken has heard of Kim Possible, but omits Ron.  Shego has heard of Ron, and refers him as ''her chum.''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H17.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken would use a shark again in Hidden Talent</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H18.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim has never heard of Dr. Drakken.  Drakken has to spell it out for her who he is.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H19.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Kim interrupts Drakken's gloating.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H50.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken uses a remote control on the shark platform.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H20.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim defeats the sharks with her constricting lipstick.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H21.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>After nearly getting eaten, Ron seems unable to move.  Kim grabs him.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H22.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego is never interested in Drakken's plots.  She's only interested in the results.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H24.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken's plot: Attach a small explosive device to the mechanical tick.  Then make people do what he says or else.  Drakken indicates that he designed the explosive device.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H23.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken has to explain to Shego what nano-technology is.  This is an indication as to why Shego needs Drakken to help her take over the world.  She doesn't know anything about advanced electronics or mechanics.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H25.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken's monitor is turned off.  Kim ejects the disk by pushing two buttons.  The first is below the cd-rom.  The other button is on the keyboard.  A device on the cd-rom pushes the disc up from the tray.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H26.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron is either fascinated by Drakken's plan.  Or he is staring at Shego.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H27.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken wants revenge on the kids who used to tease him during gym class.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H28.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim puts Drakken in the mad scientist category.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H29.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Shego's plasma hands.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H30.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H31.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken has remote controlled laser guns in his lab.  It's the same remote as the remote for the shark platform.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H32.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron steps up in a take charge position.  Kim knows Ron doesn't have any ideas.  Ron comes to this conclusion a few seconds later.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H33.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H34.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/128.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim uses her compact to deflect the lasers.  It destroys Drakken's lab.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/129.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Again, Kim grabs Ron as he is paralyzed with fear.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/130.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron jump off the side of the cliff to their safety. Kim dives; while Ron simply jumps and falls.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H35.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken lair is destroyed, but he does rebuild it.  It's not clear how Drakken and Shego survived the explosions.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H36.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>MHS sign</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H37.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim wearing her cheerleader outfit.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H38.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H39.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim bumps into Big Mike.  Kim and Ron then have a discussion about the social ladder.  Kim feels herself superior.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/189.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time Kim asks, ''What's the sitch?''</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H40.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H41.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of the MHS cheerleaders. The cheerleader to the left of Bonnie is unknown. She's been in several episodes, but has never been a part of the main group, or given a name. The others are (from left to right) Crystal, Bonnie, Liz, and Hope. Marcella, Jessica, and Tara are all missing until a later episode. Kim says, ''Bring it on!'' This is a possible reference to the movie of the same name, which is about cheerleaders.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H42.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>. Barkin finds out about Rufus.  Ron doesn't get in trouble for this.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H43.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Bonnie reminds Kim that cheerleaders don't get detention.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H44.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see Drakken whine and cry about a defeat at the hands of Kim.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H45.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Shego has a tracking device and knows the mechanical tick is at a high school.  Drakken concludes that Kim has the nano-tick.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H46.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Junior notices Kim has a zit.  Vinnie says cheerleaders don't get zits.  Then Junior concludes that it is actually a tiny explosive device.  Junior seems to be more technically advanced than anyone imagined.Or he is very lucky at guessing.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H47.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>A close up view of the nano-tick on Kim's nose.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H48.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First time we see Kim use her gymnastic skills.  Kim uses them to escape Mr. Barkin's detention.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/H49.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>The episode turns red to show how angry Mr. Barkin is.</p><br>

<img src="images/tick_trivia/146.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim and Ron with helmets. First appearance of Ron's scooter. Ron says he talked to Wade. Ron must have contacted Wade on Kim's locker computer.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/147.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>First appearance of Drakken's flying car.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/148.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Kim indicates that Wade is never wrong.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/149.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Ron's scooter takes a few minutes to get started. Then it runs fine. Ron never does get it fixed.</p>
<img src="images/tick_trivia/150.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<p>Drakken's gravatomic ray comes out of the bottom of the flying car by pushing a lever with a red knob forward.</p>
