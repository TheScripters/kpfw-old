Each tentacle end has a red light beaming from it.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The tentacles get very close to the safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A television camera comes to the back of the robot.  It appears the tentacles are actually sensors that are able to analyze how to open the safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior enjoys being a criminal.  Junior would rather be disco dancing.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates that an experiment prototype of some sort is inside the safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The robot opens the safe.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior indicates that the experimental prototype can be purchased online.

Safes are usually airtight.  Kim would have ran out of air unless air is being pumped in somehow.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior calls Kim, “My feisty teen nemesis.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shows up behind Senior and Junior with Global Justice soldiers.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior remember Ron’s name, but Junior does not.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands Senior to surrender.  She omits Junior, indicating that she knows that Junior doesn’t quite share his father’s evil tendencies.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior takes a remote from his jacket and pushes the button.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The remote is the same remote that Senior used in The New Ron to activate the spinning tops of doom.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The remote activates a jet pack on Junior.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior reaches into his jacket and grabs another remote.  He doesn’t push the button yet.  His jet pack is activated a few seconds after Junior’s.  It may have been stuck or delayed to make sure he’s far enough away from Junior that they don’t hit each other.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior’s second remote is identical to his previous remote.<br/><br/> <img src="images/animal_attraction/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The second remote activates a small detonation that blows a hole in the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Global Justice soldiers are unable to capture Senior or Junior.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior and Junior fly through the hole in the roof.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron compliments Senior on his polite manner, even though he a criminal.<br/><br/>

She reads, “At a fork in the road, you stop.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron approaches Kim and asks her a question from a book entitled Animology.  Despite being a personality quiz, Ron asks for advice anyways.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains that Ron is into the animology fad that is sweeping the school.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The cover on the book has an elephant and what appears to be a bear.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains that animology is just a cross between astrology and a personality quiz.  Ron indicates that animology assigns both an animal and a color.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim isn’t interested in animology.  Ron tries to entice her by indicating that it can find your perfect mate.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim acts like a monkey and says she doesn’t want her perfect mate as a blue baboon.  Kim made up the blue baboon remark.  Ron indicates that a blue baboon is disastrous for Kim anyways.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries to pep the cheer squad, but they are too interested in animology.  Tara is missing from this scene.  A new unknown cheerleader with a red ponytail is seen instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior is into animology too.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates that the safe they were trying to get into was at a weapons research facility.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Phillipe Bullion.  Senior doesn’t like Phillipe.  But he is polite to him anyways.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior and Phillipe embrace each other in old European fashion.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior invites Phillipe to have lunch with them.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phillipe indicates that Senior rarely comes to the club anymore.  Senior indicates it is because he has an active retirement.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>In this shot, the lobster is facing Senior.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>In the next shot, the lobster is facing Phillipe.  The lobster is big enough to have an apple in it’s mouth.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phillipe indicates that discretion and an extremely large personal fortune is needed to join The Billionaire’s Club.  First indication that Phillipe likes caviar.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates he has spent a lot of money to be a criminal, but still has billions of dollars to stay in the club.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phillipe indicates he checked Senior’s account to make sure he had billions for club membership.  He then eats a large spoonful of caviar in one gulp.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The lobster suddenly has grapes and caviar in front of it.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior and Kim are on the front cover of Euro Today.  Phillipe indicates this reflects poorly on the club.  He strips Senior and Junior of their club membership.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phillipe snaps his fingers summoning waiters to clear the Senior’s table.  Two of the waiters are twins, but one has dyed his hair a different color.  Also, the lobster is changed to a light shade of pink.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phillipe even takes the lobster claw that Junior was eating.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron sit at a table by themselves.  Kim is not wearing a cheerleading uniform.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The other cheerleaders are wearing uniforms.  Bonnie is sitting with two unknown cheerleaders.  The cheerleader on the left has appeared periodically throughout the series, but we don’t know her name.  The second could be Hope or Marcella with a ponytail, but this seems unlikely.  Unknown cheerleaders were common in the first season.  Bonnie invites Amelia to sit with them.  Amelia indicates she heard Bonnie was a lavender mouse.  She also indicates that she is a red otter, and there would be conflict.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amelia walks away.  The dark haired cheerleader with the ponytail is suddenly a blond.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that he finished the test.  Kim jokes that he is a blue baboon.  Ron indicates he is a pink sloth, and worst than a blue baboon.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reads, “The pink sloth is an outcast, a follower,socially inept, and smells of overripe fruit.” Ron whines that he does not smell of overripe fruit.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus pulls a banana peel out of Ron’s pocket.  This indicates that Ron really does smell of overripe fruit.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron catches the banana peel.  He then wonders if animology has a pink naked mole rat.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron leaves the animology book behind.  Kim gets interested in it.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The question Kim reads is, “You arrive at the multiplex to find that the movie you’ve come to see is sold out.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior reads the question, “If you were a tree, what tree do you think you would be.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior whines about being banned from The Billionaire’s Club and promises revenge.  Junior points out there are other clubs that they could join.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior plots a way that he could crash the markets and freeze the accounts of The Billionaire’s Club members.  He also prepares himself a glass of water with ice.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior jokes they would need a large freezer to do that.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior is first annoyed at Junior’s remark.  Then he gets a plan.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is missing supper.  She told her father that she was working on a big test.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is having trouble with the personality quiz.  On one hand, she doesn’t want to appear weak.  On the other hand, she doesn’t want to appear stubborn.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t want to tell her mom what she is doing.  Then she confesses she doing animology.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible demands Kim go to bed when it’s getting to late.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim continues the test by flashlight.  Kim reads the question, “A mysterious stranger calls your name.  You most likely to---”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells her father that she’s a blue fox.  She grabs an apple, then leaves.  This freaks Mr. Possible out a bit.  Like all personality quizzes, Kim could have changed the answers over and over again until she got the results she wanted.  This is particularly suspicious since she spent most of the afternoon on one question.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible reads that the blue fox is a born leader, can’t resist a challenge, driven to excel, and a perfectionist.  The soul mate for the blue fox is the yellow trout.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible doesn’t want Kim to be looking for a soul mate.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible comforts Mr. Possible by indicating that animology is just a temporary teen fad.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible is a teal cat.  Mr. Possible is a beige raccoon.  They are soul mates.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim listens intently on who might be a yellow trout.  The background student in red indicates he is a yellow bear.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim overhears Amelia talking to Liz about a student who sits next to her in English is a yellow rabbit.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim opens her locker by turning the knob left, right, then left again.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron surprises Kim and proclaims that animology is bogus.  He refuses to believe he is a pink sloth.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim and indicates he has some information she requested.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wants the information later.  She tries to cover up the fact that she’s now into animology and took the test from Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim told Wade that the information was the highest priority, and utmost rush.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wants to hear the information.  He most likely believes it to be about an upcoming mission.  Ron indicates that it would give them a break from all the talk about animology.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates he checked the school databases.  But there is no way to tell who is a yellow trout.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is annoyed that Kim is now into animology.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/animal_attraction/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron can’t believe that Kim is into animology.  Kim indicates she only took the quiz for laughs.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kimmunicator beeps.  Kim immediately demands to know who the yellow trout is.  Ron now knows how seriously Kim is taking animology.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that Kim got a hit on her site from Pop Pop Porter.  Kim doesn’t know who Pop Pop Porter is.  Ron explains that Pop Pop Porter revolutionized the frozen food industry.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade and Ron love Pop Pop Porter’s mini corn dogs.  Ron calls them, “Nature’s perfect food.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she avoids fried foods.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that Pop Pop Porter’s food is not fried, it is flash frozen.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Pop Pop Porter.  Wade uploads the streaming video of Pop Pop Porter indicating someone stole his state of the art flash freezing cryovator.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade streams Kim a commercial for flash frozen mini corn dogs.  This is the same commercial seen previously in Pain King vs. Cleopatra.  Ron indicates that the mascot for the mini corn dogs is named “Little corn doggie.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pop Pop Porter gives Kim and Ron a ride.  He has a blimp in the shape of a corn dog.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pop Pop Porter shows where the cryovator was stolen.  Kim and Ron might have changed clothes in the blimp, or when they got into the factory.    <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus start crying over the loss of the corn dogs.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim smells something familiar.  She uses the kimmmunicator’s air analyzer.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hugs Pop Pop.  This freaks him out a bit.  Then Pop Pop gives Ron permission to eat the mini corn dogs so they don’t spoil.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus eat a numerous amout of mini corn dogs.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim and indicates that the familiar smell is expensive cologne for an exclusive clients.  Wade has a drink of some sort.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assumes correctly that the cologne belongs to Senior Senior Junior.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade is disappointed that Kim figured it out.  Wade turns off the kimmunicator signal in frustration.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron scale the Senior’s private island with suction cups on their hands and feet.  They argue about whether or not the Seniors want corn dogs or something much more.  Kim and Ron had a similar argument in the episode Crush.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron find the cryovator.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron are attacked by a large robot.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron are captures by the robot’s tentacles.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior finally corrects Ron he has a bigger plan than just mini corn dogs.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim becomes smug.  Ron says, “You blue foxes think you know everything.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior gets excited that Kim and Ron studied animology.  Senior gets frustrated.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior reveals the first part of his plan: Flash freeze Kim and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior uses the same remote as from the beginning of the episode.  This activates the tentacles on the robot.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron are laid down on a conveyer belt.  Metal clamps go around their hands, feet, and chest.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior then reveals the second part of his plan: Freeze The Billionaire’s Club.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior displays his new cryovator.  This one is bigger than Pop Pop’s and big enough to freeze the entire island The Billionaire’s Club is on.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders how big of a mini corn dog can be flash frozen with Senior’s new cryovator.  Ron is silenced when Kim kicks him in the face with her shoe.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior activates the conveyor belt with a push of a large red button.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior announces he’s a yellow trout.  This freaks Kim out.  It has been analyzed that Shego and Kim have many of the same characteristics.  This might make Shego a blue fox as well.  Shego and Junior will crush on each other in a later episode.  They might have been soul mates and not realized it. <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reminds Kim that they’re about to be flash frozen.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/animal_attraction/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior and Junior use a black helicopter to lift and carry their cryovator.  First indication that Senior knows how to fly a helicopter.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim whines about Junior being her perfect match.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim commands Rufus to push the red button.  But he is too light.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron saved nine mini corn dogs in his pocket.  He commands Rufus to eat them.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Afterwards, Rufus is almost too heavy to move.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus has trouble getting up to the button.  Once he does, he sits on it and makes it go down.  <br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The conveyor belt stops.  Kim calls Rufus, “Good little hairless rodent.”<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus goes to sleep.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s feet are frozen.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to stand up, but slides instead.  He crashes into something off camera.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drags Ron by his shirt while he tries to keep his balance.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim looks for a way to get to The Billionaire’s Club.  Senior has two sailboats and a regular boat.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior also has two surfboards, some scuba gear, and a jet ski.  Kim settles for the jet ski.  If Kim can reach The Billionaire’s Club by jet ski, then Senior doesn’t live very far away from it.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim agrees with Ron that animology is bogus.  The salnacoer from the ocean must have melted the ice on Ron’s feet.  Also there is no tissue damage, showing how well the cryovator can preserve something.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus comes out of Ron’s pocket to enjoy the wind.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus goes flying off the jet ski.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron throws Rufus a rope.  Rufus catches it, then hits the water.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus now enjoys water skiing instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/animal_attraction/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This background was previously used in Kimitation Nation as Shego’s vacation spot.
