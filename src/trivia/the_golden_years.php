Show notes: This episode introduces Nana Possible.  It also is a second season episode that chronologically fits better as a Season 1 episode.  This episode takes place directly after Job Unfair.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The episode starts out with the Possible family driving in Mrs. Possible’s van with a trailer attached.  The song Mr. and Mrs. Possible are singing is the classic folk song, The Camp Town Ladies.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus enjoy singing along with Mr. and Mrs. Possible.  Ron also did this previously in Downhill.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is wearing pink pants and a white shirt with a heart on it.  She is annoyed with her parents and Ron singing.  Jim and Tim have earpieces on and are most likely listening to music.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The van pulls into Chez Leisure.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Everyone gets out of the van.  Kim pulls earplugs out of her ears.  Kim was most likely wearing them to drown out her parents and Ron singing.  Here is another possible indication that Middleton is in Colorado.  Kim indicates that the trip took sixteen hours.  A trip by car from Colorado to Florida can be accomplished in roughly sixteen hours with good timing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible jokes that they were traveling at the speed of fun.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Of course, Kim didn’t think the trip was fun.  Ron is wearing a new light blue shirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible thanks Ron for helping move Kim’s grandmother.  Mr. Possible then begins stacking heavy boxes into Ron’s arms, including one with easily breakable stuff.  It is widely believed that Nana Possible lived in Middleton before moving to Florida.  This is unlikely since in Attack Of The Killer Bebes, Drakken looked in the Middleton phone book and found only one entry for the family name Possible.  Where Nana lived prior to Florida is unknown. <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus put on sunglasses.  Ron indicates that they are in The Sunshine State, better known as Florida.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates Ron has never met her grandmother.  First indication that Kim is at odds with her grandmother.  Kim reveals her grandmother’s name as Nana.  We don’t know if this is her real name or not.  Nana is often a pet name for grandmothers.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible reminds Kim that her grandmother loves her.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains that Nana Possible is too overprotective.  Ron consoles her by reminding her that all grandmothers are overprotective.<br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Kim’s grandmother, Nana Possible.  Nana puts a sweater over Kim and complains about her wearing revealing clothing that shows off her belly button.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana takes Kim’s hand and goes inside.  Ron understands why Kim has trouble dealing with her.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/the_golden_years/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is carrying the heavy boxes, including the one with fragile materials.  Mr. and Mrs. Possible carry matching suitcases.  Jim and Tim each carry a small box.  Kim isn’t carrying anything.  Nana is in the lead, possibly showing where they will be staying.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Possible family see some senior citizens doing yoga and meditation.  This seems to indicate that Chez Leisure is a retirement center for senior citizens.  This is encouraged by the fact that Florida is best known for it’s large number of retired seniors.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus does yoga and meditation.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana introduces Mr. Simmons.  She also indicates that Mr. Possible is her son.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Simmons goes past the Possible family and indicates that he doesn’t have time to greet them because he is in training.  This seems to indicates that Mr. Simmons wasn’t interested in meeting the Possibles.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>An elderly man is playing shuffleboard with an elderly lady.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>He knocks her piece off the 10 mark, and replaces it with his.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana indicates that the elderly man is named Mr. Stanley, and is the best at shuffleboard.  The elderly lady is not happy about losing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana then introduces the elderly as Mrs. Greenfield, and indicates she is the best at knitting.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Greenfield then indicates she knitted the sweater that Kim is wearing.  Mrs. Greenfield looks at the sleeves, which are way too long for Kim’s arms.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim nervously and sarcastically indicates that wool sweater is comfortable to wear when it’s so hot outside.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Later, Nana brings her lemon squares for everyone to enjoy.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim are reading thick books.  Jim’s book cover says “Comix.”  Tim’s book also seems to have comic frames, indicating he is most likely reading a comic book too.  However, they are so thick, they are most likely graphic novels instead of just regular comic books.  A picture of Jim and Tim hangs over the couch.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron watches Kim as she is about to unpack her suitcase.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wool has a tendency to be itchy, as Kim is finding out now.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The static electricity in the sweater causes Kim’s hair to become frizzled when she pulls it off.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron looks out the window and begins to confess that he didn’t come to Florida solely to help Nana move.  But Kim already knows this and finishes Ron’s confession before he does.  This annoys him.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wants to know what Ron’s true intensions are.  She guesses sunbathing and surfing.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he is here to meet the ladies on spring break.  This gives this episode a timeline in which it occurs.  The spring break college girl in the red bikini walking by appears quite often in this episode in the background.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus likes the idea of meeting ladies on spring break too.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim waves her hand in front of Ron, but he’s not paying any attention.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim reminds Ron that spring break is all about college students.  Ron believes this to be a good thing.  He indicates that college girls don’t know him and he can start with a clean slate.  Kim rolls her eyes at this idea.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron then indicates that he has always found high school girls immature.  This is very ironic considering that many, especially Kim, have found Ron immature.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana gives Jim and Tim some old records as a gift.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tim indicates he has heard of vinyl records, but has never seen them.  This most likely applies to Jim as well.  Jim suggests ripping the vinyl records into MP3 files.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana offers sundresses to Kim as a gift.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is horrified and tries to tell Nana that she doesn’t wear sundresses.  Kim then begins telling her grandmother about her missions.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana lays out the sundresses on the bed and complains about Kim going on missions on school nights wearing “baggy boy pants.”<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that she stopped a super villain last week who was trying to take over Canada with a weather machine.  This is a reference to the previous episode, Job Unfair.  Nana doesn’t hear Kim.  She adjusts her hearing aid.  We don’t know if Nana did this to avoid the conversation, or that she really did need to turn down her hearing aid.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible tells Kim that Nana didn’t hear her.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim.  He indicates there is a high frequency broadcast over Florida.  But he can’t pinpoint the origin or  purpose.  Kim tells Wade that she and Ron will check it out.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The signal is coming from a pink ice cream truck.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego is wearing a uniform reminiscent of a soda shop employee from the 50’s and early 60’s.  She is still wearing her gloves though.  Shego complains about how her talents are being wasted.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken also is wearing a uniform like a soda shop employee.  Unlike Shego however, his uniform has long sleeves.  Drakken also wears his gloves.  Drakken indicates that he plans on beaming an obedience signal into MP3 players and transforming them into his private army.  This is Drakken’s second attempt to do mind control, as he first tried it in The Twin Factor.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken also makes an ice cream sale, just to make his ice cream truck look legitimate.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that he is doing good business with his ice cream truck.  This really annoys Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego is driving the ice cream truck.  Drakken waves good-bye to the happy children.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken asked to be reminded to order more snow bank bars because they really sell on hot days.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is wearing a straw hat and eating an ice cream bar.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she is having trouble locking onto the signal because it is scrambled.  Kim is wearing a purple tank top and shorts.  She also has her hair in a ponytail.  Ron is wearing a yellow tank top.  He isn’t paying any attention to Kim.  Instead, he’s focused on the spring break girls wearing bikinis.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pauses and wonders where he should begin now that he has a clean slate.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim does not like the idea of Ron looking at other girls.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes to a pool party with a DJ on the loudspeaker.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries a smooth move on a spring break girl.  It doesn’t work.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus becomes interested in the belly flop contest.  The man has a sunburn except where he was wearing a t-shirt.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to hit on two more girls; and is still unsuccessful.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The girl in the green bikini is named Missy.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the DJ.  The DJ introduces Rufus as the next contestant of the belly flop contest.  Ron is shocked to hear that Rufus is the next contestant.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus does several flips before hitting the water.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite his small size, Rufus makes a tremendous splash.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets wet from Rufus’ belly flop.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is hailed as a belly flop hero.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>He even gets a kiss from the cute college girl in the red bikini.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is disappointed he’s not getting anything but splashed.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tries locking onto the signal while on the boardwalk.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets the signal locked.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees the pink ice cream van right in front of her.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken has just sold three polar ice missiles to customers.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego sees Kim coming with her rear view mirror.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/268.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego is wearing shorts with her outfit.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego begins driving away.  Drakken lets go of the three polar ice missiles.  They go flying up into the air.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim catches the polar ice missiles and hands them to the children.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pushes a button on her hat.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s hat suddenly becomes a helmet.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim does a jump into the air.  Her shoes become rocket roller blades.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken becomes horrified when he sees Kim is gaining on them.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego hopes to lose Kim by throwing out a box of ice cream to the people walking the boardwalk.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is horrified that Shego just threw out a box of fruity lickies, and indicates they are the number one seller.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>As planned, kids come running for the free ice cream.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim does a flip and avoids running into the children.  She lands and keeps on pursuing Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The ice cream van parks behind the sign of Chez Leisure.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken thinks they have lost Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sees the ice cream truck.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suddenly sees her grandmother.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim loses control.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim lands in a hammock.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana scolds Kim for doing something that might get her hurt.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim watches as the ice cream truck pulls away.  Kim blames her grandmother for letting the bad guys get away.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Nana talk about what happened earlier.  A picture of Kim and Mr. and Mrs. Possible together are hanging on the wall.  These pictures are right next to the picture of Jim and Tim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana asks Kim if there are men trained to handle super villains.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Once again showing some overconfidenence, Kim indicates she is trained to handle super villains.  She fails to mention anybody else or any organization like Global Justice taking care of super villains.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana suggests that Kim is going through a teen rebellious phase.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim denies being a teen rebellion.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana ends the conversation by indicating she is going to bed.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim throws herself on the couch in disgust, much like she would do on her bed if she were at home.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible tries talking Kim about Nana.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible suggests a game of Strategories.  This interests Jim and Tim.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim calls dibs on the race car.  This is a subtle reference to the game Monopoly, which uses a race car as a token to move.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken has a hide out deep in the everglade jungles of Florida.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken has a pit of alligators in his hide out.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s plan: His signal should have infected every MP3 player within a hundred miles.  He plans to activate the mind control signal, and have an army of spring breaking teens.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Unimpressed with Drakken plan, Shego sits by and files the claws in her gloves.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Phase 2 of Drakken’s plan: He will then launch a satellite to create a world full of teen zombies.  Then they will help him take over the world.  Drakken then asks Shego to remind him to order more fruity lickies.<br/><br/>





<a name="act2"></a>
<img src="images/the_golden_years/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken uses the term “off the heeze” to describe the plan.  According to the urban dictionary, this means it is going crazy or out of control.  To activate the signal, Drakken pushes three different buttons on the console, pushes a lever on the console forward, pulls a lever down that seems suspended in midair, pushes two more buttons on the console, then turns the knob.  <br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken shows Shego his book entitled “Teen Slang.”  Drakken then uses slang words to describe how good his plan is.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken opens up the book.  It is a dictionary of slang words.  They are: <br/><br/>Abe (noun) A unit of currency equal to five american dollars.<br/><br/>ALL-DAT (pronoun)  All that exists, all that relates to the subject.<br/><br/>AX (verb) To make a request of; to make a request for, to inquire/<br/>“Get over here foo and let me ax you a question.”<br/><br/>BAG (noun) Whatever you’re into<br/><br/>Beef (noun)  To have a problem or perceive a problem/<br/>“Yo, if you got beef wit me then tell me don’t gimme the vapors.”<br/><br/>Caddy (noun) A car with style and plush seats<br/><br/>Chill (adj)  Keenly aware of or knowledgeable about the latest trends or developments.  Very fashionable or stylish.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken claims he needs to know the teen vocabulary for when they are his personal army.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego makes fun of Drakken by calling him hip.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken pulls a final lever on the console to activate the mind control signal.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana Possible is asleep and is suddenly awakened.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Scatagories looks very much like a Monopoly board.  It has two stacks of cards in the middle, separated by a red stripe.  An hourglass timer sits beside Kim.  Kim indicates that she is taking science and nature for the block.  This seems to indicate that Scatagories has questions that must be answered, similar to Trivia Pursuit.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana indicates she is going out for some air, and is carrying her lemon squares.  Her voice is deadpanned like she is under mind control.  Kim, her father, and the twins don’t notice this.  They are too involved in the game.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana leaves the door open.  Nobody notices this either.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego are getting impatient about how long the personal army of mind controlled teens is taking to get to the hideout.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken suddenly indicates he is picking up movement with his radar.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken goes to the door and prepares to welcome his personal army.<br/><br/><img src="images/the_golden_years/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana Possible leads the senior citizens into Drakken’s hideout.

The flyer has a picture of Rufus playing a guitar.  The guitar is to scale with Rufus, even though Rufus was just playing a guitar much larger than he was.  It’s been analyzed that Ron took the extra time to plan a party to save Kim because he knew that trying to save Kim on his own would get him captured, much like in Bueno Nacho.<br/><br/><br/><img src="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/KKthecat02/golden%20years/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim stares ominously at the alligators below.

Nana’s hair is the same color as Kim’s.  Nana also has been wearing glasses since she was young.  The building in the background seems to indicate that Nana is in China, but this is not confirmed.  Nana is wearing a Shaolin monk style robe, but not pants.  She may be wearing shorts.<br/><br/><img src="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/KKthecat02/golden%20years/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is suddenly kicked.

It’s unknown how or why Drakken knows so much about Nana.  Perhaps he wanted to know more about his personal army, and found ways to get the information about them.  He might have taken a special interest in Nana with her having such a colorful background.<br/><br/><img src="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/KKthecat02/golden%20years/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Nana attacks Kim.

Running with the show’s idea that Kim can do anything because she is the product of a brain surgeon and a rocket scientist, it seems that Kim genetically received her martial arts and gymnastic skills from her grandmother.  <br/><br/><img src="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/KKthecat02/golden%20years/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim jumps towards her belt and grappling hook, which are disregarded on the floor.
