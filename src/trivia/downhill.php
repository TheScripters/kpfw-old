Show notes: This episode introduces DNAmy.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign.  First time we see Middleton covered in snow.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The episode begins with the Middleton students boarding the bus for a class field trip.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First episode where Mr. Barkin has dark hair.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn't pay attention and almost hits a student with his skis. <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron almost hits Kim too.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he's not paying attention because he's, ''totally psyched!''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is looking forward to skiing with out a crazed henchman after her.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus wearing a scarf and hat.  He psyched too.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>One of the few MHS students mentioned here is Alan Platt.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron indicate that this field trip is the biggest one of the year.  They also indicate that Alan Platt's parents are the chaperones.  Ron calls it, ''humiliation nation.''  Kim then ends her sympathy by yelling, ''But better him than me!''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible suddenly shows up.  She indicates that Alan Platt's parents came down with the flu at the last minute.  Mr. and Mrs. Possible call Kim by her childhood name, ''Kimmy'' for most of this episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible says to Kim that, ''Your friend Bonnie called us.''  This indicates that Mrs. Possible didn't know that Kim and Bonnie are actually rivals.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Alan Platt isn't worried about his parents being sick.  He and the nameless girl in blue act as though they have unmentionable plans.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible then shows up carrying his special snowboard.  He indicates that they dropped the twins off at Kim's grandmother's house before coming.  We don't know if this was Mrs. Possible's mother, or Nana Possible.  If it is Nana Possible, then she is still living in Middleton before moving to Florida in The Golden Years.  Mr. and Mrs. Possible are wearing basically the same clothes.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Although Kim has figured it out, Bonnie indicates that Kim's parents are the chaperones.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time Bonnie uses a camera.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is not happy with the sudden turn of events.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/down_hill/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie taunts Kim, then indicates pictures of Kim and her parents could end up in the yearbook.  This indicates that Bonnie is taking pictures for the yearbook.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim knows that Bonnie called her parents on purpose.  Bonnie calls Kim paranoid.  Bonnie then calls Kim's parents, ''cute.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible shows off his home made snowboard to Ron.  Mr. Possible then says, ''I'm ready for shreddy.''  Ron doesn't know what Mr. Possible is talking about.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim worries about her father trying to act cool.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible suggests a travel game that Kim used to love to play.  Mr. Possible then indicates that Kim needed to use the restroom a lot.  Everyone has a laugh at Kim's expense.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Bonnie will pay for embarrassing Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hands Kim a tabloid newspaper.  The headline reads, ''The snow beast of Mount Middleton makes tracks.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that this story is from the same reporter who did a story on a frog boy.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he was touched by the frog boy story.  It showed his struggle to fit into a world that could never really accept him.  Ron also indicates the newspaper's name is ''The Wonder.''  The Wonder is offering five thousand dollars for a clear picture of the snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron realizes that everyone is staring at him as he talks about the snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin asks Ron if he really believes the story about the snow beast.  Ron pretends he isn't sure.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that Kim's parents are about to do a sing-a-long.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible wants Kim to help sing.  He also indicates that Kim has a beautiful singing voice.  This becomes more than obvious in Hidden Talent.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Possible begin singing, ''Ninety-nine bottle of pop on the wall.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron helps with the sing-a-long.  Ron will do this again in a later episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite having a bus load of students, the bus is on treacherous roads next to sheer cliff that are covered with ice.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the ski Mount Middleton lodge.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin approaches Ron and asks him if he's ready to find the snow beast.  Not only does Mr. Barkin believe in the story about the snow beast, Mr. Barkin wants the five thousand dollars in cash for the clear picture of it.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin offers Ron two percent of the five thousand dollars.  Ron is so horrible at math, he accepts the offer.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus thinks that there is something fishy about only getting the two percent that Mr. Barkin offered.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron leaves Kim just when she needs him the most.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim overhears her mother telling about how on their first ski trip, Kim took all her clothes off in the middle of the lodge.  She was only two years old at the time.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drags her mother to the side and scolds her for telling that story.  Mrs. Possible assures her that two year olds tend to strut around naked once in a while.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin has Ron carry all the gear and supplies.  Ron complains that when he snow hikes with Kim, they usually get sherpas.  This indicates that Kim and Ron have missions on occasion in the Tibet or Nepal regions.  Sherpas are mountain guides.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin asks Ron if he heard a sound.  Ron says,  ''Teeth chattering, knees knocking, bladder sloshing, that's me!''  This indicates Ron is cold and needs to use the bathroom.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast growls.  It's loud enough to  shake the earth and trees.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Mr. Barkin are now convinced beyond any doubt that there is a snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Mr. Barkin quickly try to track and find the snow beast.  All they get is a dark shadow over them.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast growls again.  It causes a small avalanche.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Mr. Barkin slide down a hill.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>They then fall off a cliff.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus lands safely in the snow.  Ron lands safely on Mr. Barkin.  Mr. Barkin lifts Ron up with one hand and throws him to the side.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast growls again.  The trees shake.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin stays calm and gets the camera ready to take a picture of the snow beast.  Ron hides behind Mr. Barkin.  Rufus grabs onto Ron's face.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast turns out to be a woman.  First appearance of DNAmy.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has trouble pulling Rufus off of his face.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reveals they were looking for the snow beast.  Amy chastises them for believing a fairy tale.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Mr. Barkin deny believing the story about the snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The woman introduces herself as Amy Hall.  This might be a play on the movie ''Annie Hall.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After Mr. Barkin introduces himself, Amy begins calling him, ''Stevie.''  Mr. Barkin doesn't like this.  Mr. Barkin is the first guy DNAmy crushes on in the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy explains that she got lost in the mountains.  She wants an escort from Mr. Barkin to the lodge.  Mr. Barkin begins turning her down.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron steps in and offers to help.  It's been theorized on the message boards that Ron feels the need to help a woman in distress.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy indicates pink is her favorite color.  She hits Mr. Barkin on the arm while telling him this.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin drags Ron to the side.  He would rather get the pictures of the snow beast.  Ron indicates they have to help a lady on the line.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron seems to be trying to set Mr. Barkin up with Amy.  He calls Mr. Barkin, ''babe magnet.''  This annoys Mr. Barkin.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Mr. Barkin lead Amy back to the lodge.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast shows up shortly afterwards.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/down_hill/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The nameless girl in blue hangs out with more guys than any other girl in the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible talks to Bonnie.  He indicates he build his snow board from ''odds and ends'' he found at the space lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suddenly shows up.  She's worried that Bonnie is using her father and his snow board to embarrass her again.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tricks her father into believing that his snow board is cooler than anyone else's.  So he shouldn't show it off.  Mr. Possible agrees.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim goes back to Bonnie to discuss what she is doing.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>They are distracted by Ron, who comes down a hill on a snow board and stops clumsily.  This sprays snow all over Bonnie.  Ron didn't bring a snowboard; he brought skies.  This has to be Kim's snowboard.  She uses it later in this episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie doesn't believe that what Ron did was an accident.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie leaves.  Ron spraying Bonnie with snow wasn't an accident.  But Ron still has trouble keeping his balance.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy hangs onto Mr. Barkin.  She indicates she plans on the two of them having hot cocoa with mini marshmallows at the lodge.  Mr. Barkin tries to decline.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim notices the ''otterfly'' that Amy has on.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy asks if Kim collects cuddle buddies.  Kim is afraid to answer.  Cuddle buddies are a play on beanie babies; the toys that were vastly collected by soccer moms in the 1990's.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible shows up and reveals the truth.  Kim went wild for cuddle buddies.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy indicates she was the past president of the cuddle buddies collector's club.  She also indicates that fans of cuddle buddies are called, ''coddlers.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy indicates that otterfly is her favorite cuddle buddy.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible indicates that Kim has a pandaroo that she would never let her mother wash.  She also indicates that Kim still sleeps with him.  Oddly, Kim's pandaroo has never been seen in the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie delights in knowing Kim's cuddle buddy secrets.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees Kim looking depressed.  Kim indicates that Bonnie knows about pandaroo.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn't pay much attention.  He asks for the kimmunicator instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim hands Ron the kimmunicator.  But she scolds him for not being more sympathetic.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron calls Wade.  Wade indicates that there are no historical sightings or local legends pertaining to the snow beast of Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim can't believe that Ron got Wade involved.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron unintentionally reveals to Wade that The Wonder was offering a reward for the picture of the snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that Barkin is giving him ten percent of the reward.  It's not known when Mr. Barkin talked to Wade.  Ron must have contacted him by phone to ask Wade for help.  Mr. Barkin must have talked to Wade afterwards.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to give the kimmunicator back.  Kim declines it.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron then asks Kim to come along and help find the snow beast.  Kim declines that too.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible overhears Kim complain that her parents have her in ''humiliation nation.''<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin gets Ron to get back onto the slopes before Amy can give him any more hot cocoa.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Back on the slopes, Ron falls into a foot print of the snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin begins taking pictures of the snow tracks.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is alerted when something moves in the tress.  Ron says, ''It didn't sound beast sized.''  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A dog comes out of the trees.  This is what Ron heard.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The dog snaps at Mr. Barkin with crab like claws.  First time Mr. Barkin says, ''Cheese and crackers!'' when surprised.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin tries to get a picture of the crab dog.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The snow beast suddenly shows up.  Ron and Mr. Barkin are too frightened to move.  Ron drops the kimmunicator.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy suddenly shows up scolding the snow beast.  It seems to obey her.  Amy also has two others who are with her.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thanks Amy for taming the beast and saving him.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin figures it out.  The snow beast belongs to Amy.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy demands her henchmen to grab the camera.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is grabbed.  His camera is taken from him.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thinks that Amy wants the reward for herself.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The henchman crushes the camera with one hand.  Ron now knows that Amy is evil.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin struggles with the henchman.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The henchman is a pig man.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is too shocked to fight anymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pulls the mask off of the other henchman.  It's really a bird man.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is knocked out by a snowball to the head.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy tells her henchmen to take Ron and Mr. Barkin to the lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is lifted up with one hand by the bird henchman.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Amy gets back to the lab by riding her snow beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is carried over the shoulder by the pig henchman.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kimmunicator can modify itself to have a periscope.

Mr. Possible says, ''Groovy!''  The background characters laugh.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn't say anything.  Her actions say it all.

She indicates they overheard Kim talking about humiliation nation.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Possible leave Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade almost hits Kim's foot with the kimmunicator rocket sled.

<img src="images/down_hill/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets to this mission by snowboarding.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks Wade to search the cuddle buddy website.  They profile all major cuddle buddy collectors.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The web site has DNAmy's profile.  It indicates that she is a geneticist.  It also indicates that she was kicked out of her university for unorthodox splicing experiments.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim scolds herself for not listening to Ron talk about the snow beast.  Kim then asks Wade to scan the mountain for geological anomalies.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First possible location of Middleton.  The map shows the anomalies in West Virginia and Ohio.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade then finds artificial reinforcements in a large cavern to the north.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim snowboards towards the cavern.

The tables are put in at a laying position.  Then they prompt themselves up to a standing position.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus tears up and waves good-bye to Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron does the same to Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>DNAmy activates the DNA sequencer machines.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim comes in and hides behind a computer terminal.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is attacked by a cat with a snake's body.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It wraps itself around Kim.  It's most likely half anaconda since it tries to squeeze Kim<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim loses her balance.  Everyone watches as Kim falls down the stairs.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim lands in DNAmy's collection of cuddle buddies.  The cat-snake appears to be unconscious.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands DNAmy to let Ron, Rufus, and Mr. Barkin.  She holds the cuddle buddies hostage.  Then she realizes she's holding a pandaroo superstar edition, and there were only twelve made.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bird man and pig man attack.  Kim throws the pandaroo and seallion at them.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim moves out of the way.  The henchmen fall, slide, and hit the shelf containing DNAmy's collection.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>DNAmy whistles.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The whistling seems to be a command to get the rhino rabbit to attack.

And he's wearing Mr. Barkin's clothes.  It's been theorized on the message boards that Rufus might be slightly altered by having some of Mr. Barkin's DNA, and vice versa.  This is unlikely since Mr. Barkin or Rufus don't appear out of the ordinary for the rest of the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin comes out naked.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin got a bathrobe from somewhere.

It can outrun an avalanche.  <br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible manages to catch everyone and doesn't stop.

The avalanche goes off the cliff.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron compliments Mr. Possible on his rocket sled.  Ron and Kim have switched sides.  A minor mistake.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin covers his eyes.  Ron enjoys the ride just a bit too much.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After landing, the MHS students all cheer for Mr. Possible; even Bonnie.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin now has his regular clothes on.  A minor mistake.<br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim makes up with her father.  Mr. Possible says, ''No big.''<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/down_hill/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>DNAmy is arrested.  How she survived the lab explosion is a mystery.
