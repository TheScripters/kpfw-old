Show notes: This episode emphasizes Ron’s lack of math skill.  It also shows Ron’s mechanical genius.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Miss Whisp, the algebra teacher.  She indicates she gave a pop quiz, and is somewhat happy with the results.  Miss Whisp is the first real teacher to be seen teaching a class.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/274.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sits on the last row.  Ron sits behind Kim.  Vinnie, first seen in Tick Tick Tick, sits on the front row.  The seating will change later in the episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets her quiz paper back, and has an A minus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim holds up her algebra textbook, indicating this is the class she is taking.  She also indicates she was studying hard during the river boat down the Congo.  The textbook is wet and has African style blow darts sticking out of it.  A pop quiz would have been a surprise for the class, indicating that Kim studies even when she doesn’t necessarily have to.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn’t remember studying at all.  Kim indicates that Ron spent nine hours playing bingo on the kimmunicator.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp is about to give Ron his pop quiz paper back.  Ron hopes he didn’t get fail.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets an F on his pop quiz.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp begins laughing like a maniac and turns red.  The screen then fades out.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wakes up from the dream he was having.  Rufus is asleep on top of Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron nearly jumps out of his seat.  Rufus falls into Ron’s algebra book.  It then closes on Rufus.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron calms down and is begins tell Kim about the test score in his dream.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp gives Ron his pop quiz back.  Ron’s dream has come true.  He has an F.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/naked_genius/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes out of algebra complaining that he has gotten three F’s on the past three tests.  Kim and Ron are passed by the nameless girl in blue escaping class.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comments that he’s brainless.  Rufus taps on Ron’s head and implies that it is hallow.  This annoys Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s locker is right outside her algebra class.  Kim tells Ron that he needs to realize his potential.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that he has heard that he has potential before.  He then makes a joke that it sounds like a tagline from a movie.  “Ron Stoppable is Potential Boy!”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts her arm around Ron, a move that surprises him.  She also suggests that they do something fun together.  Algebra class might take place before lunch.  Kim could be suggesting they do something fun during their lunch break.     <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade suddenly comes on Kim’s locker computer.  Kim keeps her arm around Ron while Wade is talking.  Wade indicates that there is a breach at a top secret underground defense lab outside Des Moines, Iowa.  This indicates that Kim now has access to highly classified facilities.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim had other plans besides a mission.  She and Ron seem a little disappointed about going on one.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A large computer with a giant screen with flashing colors is in the top secret underground lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The computer and the wall behind it are destroyed by a drilling machine of some sort.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego come out of the drilling machine, indicating who is behind this scheme.  They both have to descend a ladder to reach the ground.  Drakken complains about having back pain.  He also whines that Shego talked him out of getting the model with heated seats and lumbar support.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego indicates that the model Drakken wanted also had a sunroof.  A sunroof on an underground drilling machine would have been dangerous and impratical.  A sunroof is supposed to allow sunlight and wind come through while driving.  Heated seats, lumbar support, and sunroofs are all items found on luxury vehicles.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is about to complain about Shego’s sarcasm when he sees what he has come to get.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken sees Project Phoebus.  It looks like a beauty salon hair dryer from the 1950’s and 1960’s.  Drakken indicates that once he manipulates his mind with an experimental beam, he should become more brilliant and will be able to design a doomsday weapon.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego anxiously begins power up Project Pheobus.  This is done by pulling a lever on a nearby console down.  Drakken suddenly protests Shego powering Project Phoebus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates he wants to document his quest for world domination.  He pulls out a camera from inside his lab coat.  He indicates that the camera came free with the test drive on the drilling machine.  Some auto dealers give away cheap gifts as a way to get buyers to come in and test drive their vehicles.  Drakken then throws the camera to Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego takes Drakken’s picture.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The flash blinds Drakken for a second.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Unhappy with his first pose, Drakken demands another picture taken.  This time, with Project Phoebus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego takes another picture.  Meanwhile, Kim and Ron enter the underground lab.  The door opens, and resembles a shutter on a camera.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite being a civilian, Kim salutes the military personal in charge.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Lieutenant Franklin.  Lieutenant Franklin indicates that somebody broke in and locked everyone out.  Like all military personal, Lieutenant Franklin uses the term o-eight hundred hours to tell time, meaning 8:00 am.  The television screens have nothing but static, but occasionally flicker showing the locked doors.  The scientists in the background were first seen in the episodes Monkey Ninjas In Space, and The Ron Factor.  Lieutenant Franklin’s uniform is blue, indicating he is with the U.S. Air Force.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Lieutenant Franklin indicates that the target appears to be Project Phoebus.  Kim tries getting more information about Project Phoebus.  Lieutenant Franklin does know that Project Phoebus is a level five top secret government experiment, but that is all that he knows.  He also indicates that nobody at the facility knows what Project Phoebus does.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron can’t believe that nobody knows what Project Phoebus does.  This comment annoys Lieutenant Franklin.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego appear on the monitor.  Drakken is still trying to get the perfect pose, and complains that his eyes were shut during the last picture taken.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Lieutenant Franklin indicates the only way into the lab is by a small ventilation duct.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus pops out of Ron’s pocket knowing that he is needed.  Kim grabs Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is placed into the ventilation shaft.  Rufus wears a hardhat with a light attached similar to what underground miners wear.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim instructs Rufus to get into the lab, let them in, but keep it quiet.  The vent is then placed back into place leaving Rufus to himself.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A ventilation fan suddenly turns on.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is blown backwards by the wind from the fan.  Despite Kim asking Rufus to be quiet, he tumbles noisily toward the lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Fortunately, Shego doesn’t hear Rufus as she powers up Project Phoebus.  Shego does this by pushing up the lever this time.  Electricity covers the two electrodes on the console.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The headpiece begins to lower onto Drakken’s head.  Electricity comes out of the two electrodes on the side of the headpiece too.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus lands on Shego’s head.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The headpiece stops right before descending on Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego was stunned and knocked to the floor for a second by Rufus landing on her head.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus leaps to a button that opens the door.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus slams into the button, and the wall.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The door opens by sliding left and right.  Kim and Ron were waiting just outside the door for it to open.  Kim makes a pun about Drakken having a bad hair day; another reference to Project Phoebus looking like a beauty salon hair dryer.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is so upset about seeing Kim here to ruin his plans, he can’t find the words or phrases to yell at her.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suddenly pulls out a grappling gun and fires it.  It most likely belongs to Kim.  But Ron is trying to show some confidence in his abilities.  Rufus is no longer wearing the miner’s hardhat.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron fires the grappling gun at Drakken.  Drakken ducks.  The grappling hook line attaches itself to a wall nearby some computers and monitors.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The line tightens taking Ron with it.  Ron slams into Drakken.  The two then slam into the computers and monitors.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is about to run and check on Ron.  Shego jumps right in front of her with plasma claws ready.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim shakes with fury at Shego for stopping her for a fight.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken gets up; but is too stunned to do anything.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Shego fight.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim does a flip onto some nearby stairs.  She grabs the railing for support.  Shego slashes with her plasma claws.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim nearly loses her balance.  She then realizes that Shego slashed the railing she was holding onto.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego attacks Kim again.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is bothered by Rufus going through his lab coat.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego nearly hits Kim with her plasma hands.  Kim blocks with the stair railing in her hands.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim kicks Shego off of her.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego hits the stair railing.  Her plasma power turns off.  Shego rests for a second before attacking again.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken grabs Rufus and is about to hurl him away.  Drakken says, “I believe it’s time for a little mole removal.”  Mole removal is surgically taking off unsightly moles that are on the body.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is suddenly hit by Ron using a desk table with wheels.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego charges her plasma again.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego takes a few swipes at Kim.  Kim dodges her attacks, and gets off the stairs.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego does a downward thrust against Kim.  Kim once again blocks using the stair railing.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego backs off and tries to kick Kim.  Kim trips Shego with the stair railing.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego gets back onto her feet by rolling backwards and then jumping to her feet.  This is a move used by martial artists to quickly get back up when knocked down.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron, Rufus, and Drakken slam into Project Phoebus.  Drakken lands in the chair.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus lands on top of the headpiece.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is hurled into some steel kegs.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego attacks Kim again.  Kim blocks with the stair railing.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego finally knocks the stair railing out of Kim’s hand.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego advances on Kim to attack.  Kim trips Shego.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego trips into the console of Project Phoebus.  This activates it.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus tries to crawl off the headpiece, but lands on Drakken’s head instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken feels the electrical impulses going through the headpiece.  This is why he feels that he was made more brilliant, not realizing that Rufus actually got the supreme intellect.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim watches Drakken and is distracted.  Shego smashes Kim with a steel container.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The force of the hit makes Kim go flying into two nearby tables and a monitor.  One of the tables is the same one Ron used against Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego pushes up on the lever this time to turn Project Phoebus off.  A minor mistake.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The headpiece comes up.  Steam or smoke comes out of the headpiece.  It either got too hot and began to burn.  Or it got hot and water came out to cool it down turning it into steam.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken feels that he is now more brilliant because of Project Phoebus.  Rufus comes out of the headpiece, lands on the floor, and is bewildered by the sudden amount of intellect.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken and Shego exit by the same hole they made when they came into the underground lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron leave the lab thinking that Drakken and Shego came in to steal Project Phoebus, but are now gone so it is safe.  They don’t realize that Rufus was affected by the machine.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is babysitting the twins for the night.  Jim and Tim are about to launch a rocket on the kitchen table.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes the remote for the rocket.  Kim says, “Mission scrubbed.”  This is the same thing NASA says when a mission is aborted.  Kim demands Jim and Tim take their rocket outside.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim go outside with their rocket.  Mr. and Mrs. Possible come in dressed country and western style clothing.  Kim indicates that they are going country line dancing.  We will see in a future episode that Mr. Possible older brother lives on a ranch in Montana.  This may have led to Mr. and Mrs. Possible’s new hobby.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Seeing her parents dressing in country and western style clothing and line dancing embarrasses Kim.  Kim demands that her parents use an alias when talking to people.  The aliases are Wanda and Eugene Crumholtz.  It was theorized that Eugene was Mr. Possible’s real name; and that Wanda Crumholtz was Mrs. Possible’s maiden name.  Both these theories proved incorrect.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron talks to Wade on the kimmunicator and figures out that problem three in his textbook equals all of the above answers.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim takes back the kimmunicator and indicates that Wade is trying to tutor Ron.  Wade is unsuccessful and frustrated.  Wade bonks his head on his keyboard and indicates that problem three isn’t even a multiple choice answer.  Ron was obviously doing the wrong question, but was supposed to be doing problem three.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim decides to takes over Ron’s tutoring.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wants Ron to try a word problem.  Ron is so frustrated with math, he exaggerates that his head is about to explode.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Studying hard makes Ron sleepy.  Ron is about to take a nap on his textbook.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hears the blast off of Jim and Tim’s rocket.  He thinks his head really is about to explode.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim’s rocket comes through the window, and flies around the kitchen before heading through the rest of the house.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Jim and Tim realize they’re in trouble.  Kim chases after them, leaving Ron to himself with Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron talks to Rufus about how hopeless he is at math.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus suddenly does a whole page of algebra in just a few seconds.  This shocks Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus follows that up with five more pages worth of algebra.  Ron doesn’t bother to question how Rufus did it, he is just happy that he did.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The seating has now been changed.  Ron, now confident about his homework being right, sits in a cool, relaxed position.  Miss Whisp indicates she found Ron’s homework on her desk first thing in the morning, so she graded it early.  Apparently, Ron having his homework done in time is unusual for Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron believes he is about to receive an A plus on his homework.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron receives another F for his homework.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is shocked he got an F because his homework was done in longhand and showed all of his work.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A clock on the wall shows the time as 12:15, indicating that Kim and Ron’s math class might be right before lunch.  This is referenced earlier in the episode when Kim suggested to Ron that they do something fun to take his mind off math.  Miss Whisp indicates that Ron’s homework shows advanced calculus and chaos theory mathmatics.  Even Kim is skeptical to hear this.  Miss Whisp concludes that Ron’s homework had to have been done by someone else.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron spins the truth by indicating that no other person did his homework.  This is a correct statement, since Rufus is not a person.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp has a smaller blackboard that flips.  On the other side is a surprise for Ron.  It is a PH.D. level equation to test Ron’s math abilitity.  Miss Whisp indicates that based on Ron’s homework skill, this should be easy for him.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus crawls up Ron’s shirt, and comes out of his sleeve.  Ron then hides Rufus in the palm of his hand while he works the problem.  This makes it appear that Ron is doing the work, and not Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shocks everyone in class by performing the equation so easily.  When finished, Miss Whisp indicates the equation is right.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has math fun by joking they should get some snackage.  He writes the symbol for pi and asks everyone if they want some.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Everyone is annoyed at Ron’s math humor.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp compares Ron to other math geniuses: Aristotle, Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein.  She then adds Ron to the list and gives him a hug.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron suddenly is about to confess what is going on, but keeps quiet instead in Miss Whisp’s embrace.  Ron realizes that this is all bad though.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/naked_genius/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/> <img src="images/naked_genius/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is giving a seminar to mathematicians, but doesn’t really know what he is talking about.  Ron hopes that he can now leave.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A mathematician with an accent asks Ron to explain his procedures for finding exponents in polynomials.  Kim sits with mathematicians to support Ron.  The museum tour guide from Pain King vs. Cleopatra sits in front of Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron doesn’t actually answer the question.  He uses Rufus to show how the equations are done.  Ron is getting nervous as he hopes they let him go soon.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The woman sitting beside the mathematician in the front row is a rocket scientist, and seen in Monkey Ninjas In Space.  It’s natural for her to be there.  The man sitting at the end of the same row Kim is sitting is an actor, also seen in Monkey Ninjas In Space.  This would be unusual unless he was also a mathematician, or researching a character who was a genius at math.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains to Wade about how smart Ron suddenly is.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade passes it off that maybe Ron blossomed late in his academic years.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is surely exaggerating when she tells Wade that Ron needed to take his shoes off to count to twelve.  It can’t be believed that Ron is that horrible at math.  Kim then indicates that Ron took a genius applitude test.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade chocks on his drink when Kim tells him that Ron got a 186 on his genius applitude test, because it is fourty points higher than his score.  This indicates that Wade got a 146 on his genius applitude test.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade demands Kim to bring Ron to a computer and meet him online.  Wade is determined to get to the bottom of how Ron is suddenly a genius.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim knows that getting to Ron won’t be easy because so many people now want to talk to him.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp seems to have taken over Ron’s life as a publicist.  She indicates that Ron has no more time for questions.  She puts her arm around him and indicates that his genius needs to be shared with the world.  If Miss Whisp is Ron’s publicist, then Mr. Barkin most likely took over algebra class as a substitute.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Flashbulbs from photographers blind Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tricia Lebowski is anchorwoman for Middleton Evening News.  Ron is now making headlines.  The picture projected of Ron is obviously not his best.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tricia Lebowski indicates that Ron has designed a new international space station.  Miss Whisp stands behind Ron.  The three scientists were seen earlier in the episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has also been credited with creating the world’s first cold fusion reactor.  The cold fusion reactor has been given a ribbon cutting service.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has also been credited for completing Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony.  It is also known as Symphony Number 8 in B Minor. D. 759.  Rufus is seen in a later episode playing the piano.  It is theorized that Rufus learned how to play from the effects of Project Phoebus.  However, Rufus could also play the guitar in The Golden Years.  It could be that Rufus is just natural at music.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite getting super famous for his mathematical work, Ron comments to the news media that he just wants to pass algebra.  The media thinks that Ron is joking and laugh.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tricia’s full name is finally revealed.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken claims that his new brilliance from Project Phoebus will help him create a doomsday device.  Instead, he draws a house.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Meanwhile, Shego tries to enjoy lunch.  It is served on a cafeteria tray, indicating this is how Drakken feeds his minions.  Today’s lunch appears to be a pork chop, mashed potatos, lettuce, tomato, and a drink.  Shego’s drink cup is the same as the kind Wade is always drinking out of, and the school cafeteria.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken wants Shego’s opinion on his doomsday device plan.  Shego is not impressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken blames Shego’s lack of superior intelligence for not understanding his doomsday idea.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s next idea is a puppy dog and a horse.  Shego is still not impressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron opens his messy locker.  Books fall all around his head.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim in a new outfit.  Kim indicates that Ron has been gone for awhile on a press tour.  Kim may be a bit jealous that Ron has been getting attention or is frustrated at the lack of Ron in her life.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s locker is beside Kim’s.  Kim complains that Ron is somehow only pretending to be a genius.  Kim does this by playing on Ron’s “Potential Boy” movie plot that he mentioned earlier in the show.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus knows that Kim has already figured out that something isn’t right.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron lies to Kim and indicates he is just a late bloomer academically and with the ladies.  Ron runs his hand through his hair, but has a cowlick.  This is a subtle reference to The New Ron, when Ron’s new hairstyle makes him popular with girls.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is bemused by Ron’s comment about the ladies.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade interrupts with a challenge.  Wade challenges Ron to an “internet battle of the geniuses.”  This is a play on the phrase, “battle of the sexes.”  Ron doesn’t like this idea.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade says, “There can be only one.”  This is a reference to the movie Highlander.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The challenge begins.  Rufus moves past Ron’s sleeve and does the typing while Ron pretends to type.  Wade challenges are: <br/>Calculate the area of a four dimensional theoretical.<br/>Break a DNA sequence down to it’s base strands.<br/>Explain Pythagorean’s Theorem in relation to exponents, roots, and scientific notation formulas.<br/>Write a 400 words essay examining the popularity of sailer uniforms in Japanimation and cite examples.  Japanimation is known more as anime.  Rufus gets all of these right.  Wade concludes that Ron is a genius.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is not completely convinced that Ron is a genius.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp finds Ron and indicates that he needs to be in the auditorium preparing to reveal the cure for the common cold.  Miss Whisp indicates she found it on her desk beside Rufus.  Ron didn’t even know that he was supposed to be preparing for another press release.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Miss Whisp takes Ron by the elbow and drags him away.  Ron seems frustrated for the overexposure that he is currently receiving.  Ron even leaves the books on the floor, and his locker door open.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade wonders when Ron became a super genius.  Kim recalls that it all started after the mission involving Project Phoebus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/>Kim goes on this mission by byplane.  First appearance of Bernice.  She is repaying Kim for saving her artist’s colony after a dam break last year.  Kim indicates that it was just like fixing her fish tank at home, but needed more gum.  This indicates that Kim has a fish tank, but we have never seen it.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t jump out of the plane.  It turns upside down.  Kim simply falls out.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim then parachutes to the ground.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim then walks up to a small log cabin.  The neighborhood seems to be a series of log cabin homes with nicely paved porches and sidewalks.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Dr. Zaruda.  Dr. Zaruda seems paranoid of tax collectors, land developers, and door to door salepeople.  This seems to indicate that Dr. Zaruda has had tax problems in the past, people wanting to buy his land to turn it into something else commercially, and is annoyed with door to door salespeople.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim compares a picture of Dr. Zaruda before he became a hermit.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Dr. Zaruda worked on Project Phoebus.  Kim is convinced that he is the only one who knows what it does.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts her foot in the door before Dr. Zaruda closes it.  It’s unknown why Dr. Zaruda is so paranoid about the government.  He may have the seen Project Phoebus as something more dangerous than good.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Zaruda finally lets Kim in after she mentions Project Phoebus.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The next scene starts out with a friendly neighborhood, then shows Drakken’s ominous lair looming overhead.  This may be a reference to the movie Edward Scissorhands that also had a quiet neighborhood with a dark castle looming overhead.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken shows Shego his latest doomsday plan: A turkey.  The turkey is drawn using the outline of a hand, then adding a beak and feet.  Small children in school learn to draw turkeys this way around Thanksgiving.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego calls Drakken, “Picasso.”  This is a reference to the famous painter Pablo Picasso.  Shego is being sarcastic again.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken whines about not being brilliant as he walks past a number of discarded doomsday ideas in the trash and on the floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken can’t decide if he’s more brilliant or brillianter.  Drakken begins to realize that he didn’t gain the intelect he was hoping for.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego makes Drakken watch the news, where Tricia Lebowski indicates that Ron will unveil his cure for the common cold at Middleton Mall.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Another bad picture of Ron comes up on the news.  This is the same picture that was on the “Loser” flyer in The Golden Years.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken can’t remember Ron, a running gag throughout the series.  Shego remembers Ron as Kim’s sidekick.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken rips his televison from the floor in frustration.  Drakken then suddenly realizes that Ron gained the intelect he was hoping for.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Complex mathematics are hanging on the wall of Dr. Zaruda’s cottage, similar to those that Rufus was doing.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Zaruda pours Kim a cup of coffee or tea.  Dr. Zaruda told Kim that Project Phoebus contains the brainwave pattern of the world’s most brilliant scientists.  Dr. Zaruda then indicates that they used to be old poker buddies.  He mentions four names: Gates, which might be a reference to computer genius Bill Gates.  Nash, which might be a reference to mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr.  And Salk, which may be a reference to Jonas Salk, who created the vaccine to polio.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Zaruda indicates that getting hit with the beam would make them a super genius, but only temporary.  The effects will only last two to four more days before wearing off.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Zaruda then offers Kim some squirrel stew.  Dr. Zaruda most likely got the squirrel by hunting or trapping.  This indicates just how obsolete he is from the rest of the world now.  Kim lies and tells him she had squirrel stew for lunch.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Zaruda is glad that Drakken didn’t the brain waves because Drakken is evil.  That much brain power in the wrong hands could spell disaster.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/183.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim blinks.  Her eyes disappear for one frame.  A minor mistake<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/184.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim realizes the Drakken will kidnap Ron to have access to the brainwave patterns.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/185.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron points to a chalkboard covered with equations and indicates that it should reduce car emissions<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A man in the audience indicates Ron was pointing to a time-space theorem.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sees the equation for fuel cells is on the other chalkboard.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus just shruggs off the mix up.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/189.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron passes off the time-space theorem by mentioning the sideways eight.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/190.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The same man in the audience tells Ron that the sideways eight is the symbol for infinity.  He then asks Ron if he knows this or not.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/191.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron passes off this question by asking if anybody else has any more questions.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken breaks through the ceiling where Ron is giving his presentation.  Drakken has heard Ron ask about any more questions and asks, “Care for a lift?”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken hits Ron with a modified gravatomic ray, first seen in Tick Tick Tick.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus falls out of Ron’s pocket.  When Ron flips around, his butt hits Rufus out of the gravatomic beam.  Rufus lands on the floor unhurt.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken flies away with Ron as prisoner.  Rufus knows that Ron was kidnapped for the brain power that he, not Ron, has.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/naked_genius/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has heard that Ron was kidnapped by Drakken.  Rufus and Kim both pace as Kim talks to Wade.  Wade indicates that he has to check out a few more leads and asks Kim to wait for further news.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assures Rufus that Ron will be okay and that they will find him.  She then asks him to calm down by finding something to do.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus busies himself by painting.  Rufus has a miniture etzel and wears a beret.  Berets are stereotypical items for artists (especially painters) to wear.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade finds out that Ron is not a genius by replaying a security camera of Ron doing an equation.  He then zooms in to see Rufus is actually doing the equation.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim looks over to Rufus and sees that he has painted her picture.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Wade realize that Ron can’t build a doomsday device for Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken drags Ron through his lair and complains that Ron took his brainwaves.  Ron tries to explain what happened, but Drakken doesn’t want to hear it.  Drakken can’t remember Ron’s name and simply calls him, “Boy.”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken finds the strength to lift and throw Ron around the lair.  This could be attributed to Drakken being angry and having bursts of adrenaline which can cause temporary super human strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken throws Ron.  Ron slides across the floor and into another room.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron looks up to see large boxes full of junk.  Ron asks Drakken if he is having a yard sale.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken demands Ron build a doomsday device with the items in the boxes.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to again explain to Drakken that he can’t build a doomsday device.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken thinks that Ron is simply unwilling to build a doomsday device.  Drakken insists Ron will build a doomsday device for him.  He goes over to the wall and pushes a big red button.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The floor begins to collaspe.  This is similar to the Milton Bradley game Don’t Break The Ice.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Below the collapsing floor is a moat filled with hungry piranha.  One piranha is hungry enough to jump high out of the water and attack Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/211.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron decides to attempt making a doomsday device.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/212.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Rufus are now what is most likely a real estate building.  How they got in is a mystery.  They either broke in or were allowed in.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is checking paperwork while crunching on the computer.  Rufus can now go through the computer information faster than Wade.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/214.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade is annoyed Kim calling Rufus, “the real genius.”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/215.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus finds something.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/216.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim reads the description and indicates that the recently purchased lair has ten bedrooms and six and a half acid baths.  It also contains the address.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/217.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken impatiently paces back and forth.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken gives Ron privacy while he is building his doomsday weapon.  Drakken asks if the doomsday weapon is finished.  Ron hasn’t even started yet.  He tries to stall Drakken by indicating it might take awhile.  Safety first!  Ron is wearing safety goggles.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is annoyed when Ron suggests that he take a “freak’s single cruise” while waiting for the doomsday device.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Still feeling the adrenaline, Drakken rips the metal door into shreds.  Drakken says, “That doomsday device better work!  Otherwise, you’ll be swimming with the fish.”  This is a play on line “sleeping with the fishes.“ from The Godfather.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken can’t decide if the correct pronounciation is fish or fishes.  Shego files the claws in her gloves and indicates that both forms are correct.  This annoys Drakken.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/222.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is about to unveil his doomsday device.  He has it covered with a sheet.  This practice is often done by artists before the unveil their latest creations.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/223.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries a final attempt to stall Drakken by speaking French.  This is another time where Ron shows his speaking ability for foreign language.  Meanwhile, Drakken quickly reveals he is wearing a watch.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken applies cartoon physics by floating in midair for a few seconds while screaming at Ron.  He yells so loud, Ron’s hair is affected.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/225.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron unveils his doomsday device.  He calls it The Mangler.  It is made with a refrigerator, a tennis racket, an exercise bike, a cooking pan, a vacuum cleaner, and a tennis ball with a wire poked through it.  The refrigerator seems to be held together with duct tape.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/226.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken does not like The Mangler.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/227.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken remembers Ron’s last name by calling him, “Mr. Stoppable.”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/228.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken pushes the big red button to collapse the floor again.  He then comments that Ron can have fun with the fish or fishes.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/229.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to escape the collapsing floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/230.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim pulls herself up to the roof, then drops down to the skylight.  She complains that she wants to invade a lair that only has one story and is a ranch style. <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/231.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus points to Ron.  Kim seels Ron standing on a single block with the piranha in the water below him.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/232.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sweats heavily as the single block he is standing on is about to give away.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/233.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The block gives away.  Ron falls.  In this shot, we can see the window Kim is looking through.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/234.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus pushes a button on Kim’s glove.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/235.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim’s glove shoots a small amount of goo through an open window.  The window is now open even though it was closed a few seconds ago.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/236.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The goo expands across the walls, just above the hungry piranha.  Ron bounces on the goo.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/237.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron bounces back up, over Drakken and Shego, and lands on the floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/238.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim assumes correctly that Rufus added some gadgets while she wasn’t looking.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/239.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Not knowing that Kim and Rufus helped Ron escape, Drakken leads Ron away.  What his next intension was is not known.  Kim jumps down into Drakken’s lair.  Ron shouts, “KP!”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/240.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Thinking that Ron is trying to distract him, Drakken picks Ron up and indicates he doesn’t believe Kim is here.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/241.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego did see Kim, but didn’t immediately respond.  Shego makes fun of Kim’s outfit; just as had done previously in the episode Bueno Nacho.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/242.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego pushes over the shelf full of books.  Kim leaps out of the way before they fall on her.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/243.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus suggests shooting the goo.  Kim does this.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/244.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The goo covers Drakken and Shego, but not Ron.  Ron runs away.  Shego seems to forget that her plasma claws would easily cut away the goo as she does not use them.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/245.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs over to Kim.  Kim complains about Shego pushing a falling bookcase onto her; and that it was too simple for her.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/246.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken uses voice recognition to activate robotic henchmen wearing armor and carrying axes.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/247.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron see that they are surrounded, except for behind which leads to the collapsed floor with the piranha filled moat.  Ron asks what happened to Drakken’s normal henchmen.  Drakken indicates that they’re at a wedding.  When asked where Shego was in Attack Of The Killer Bebes, Steve Loter indicated that she was at a wedding. The answer was a joke in reference to this scene in Naked Genius.  However, fans excuse the joke and accept the idea that Shego was at a wedding.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/248.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The axes shoot lasers at the end.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/249.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs Ron’s elbow and begins running toward the ledge.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/250.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron jump over the ledge, and hit the goo.  They narrowly miss the hungry piranha.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/251.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron bounce back up.  The armored robots shoot lasers when they see Kim and Ron in the air.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/252.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron go down, then bounce back up from the goo.  Once again, the armored robots shoot lasers at Kim and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/253.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When Kim and Ron hit the goo the third time, it breaks.  The piranha begin jumping out of the water in a hungry frenzy.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/254.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim barely manages to grab the ledge.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/255.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron lands on The Mangler.  He rolls down, gets into a seated position, and accidentally turns it on.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/256.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Mangler spins around in circles and shoots lasers.  <br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/257.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The armored robots prepare to finish off Kim.  Kim has nowhere to go.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/258.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The armored robots don’t immediately finish Kim off.  Drakken demands that they do so.  Meanwhile, he and Shego try to get out of the goo.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/259.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron realizes that The Mangler is working when he begins destroying Drakken’s computer equipment.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/260.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Kim to get down, then destroys the robots that have her surrounded.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/261.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron stops The Mangler.  He is very dizzy from the spinning.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/262.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim climbs up from the ledge.  Ron quickly recovers.  Ron says the phrase, “I am what I is.”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/263.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is annoyed when Kim gives Ron the genius credit for saving her with The Mangler.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/264.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron leave Drakken and Shego in the goo.  Fortunately, it has airholes so they breath.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/265.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that next he meets Kim, he will be more evil than before.  He then can’t decide if he is supposed to say more evil, or eviler, or more eviler.  This annoys Shego who tells him to be quiet.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/266.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is back to tutoring Ron for algebra.  This time, Ron gets the answer right.  X = 8  Kim once again makes a reference to Ron being “Potential Boy.”<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/267.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates algebra is easy compared to building a doomsday weapon.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/268.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>When asked, Ron indicates that Miss Whisp wrote an infinity symbol to indicate how much detention Ron would have.  Ron most likely got detention for the rest of the year.  It would most likely also mean that the world would find out that Ron is not the super genius after all.  Whether or not the world was told about Project Phoebus and Rufus is unclear.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/269.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron look for Rufus to see if Project Phoebus has worn off yet or not.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/270.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron approach a room.  The stairs lead to Kim’s room in the attic.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/271.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This is not Kim’s room.  The desk, chair, computer, radio, and cd holder is the same.  But the doorknob on the desk is different.  Also Kim’s cheerleading trophy is missing and replaced with two books.  The Possibles most likely bought both desks at the same time.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/272.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade and Rufus have another internet battle of the geniuses.  Wade’s questions are:<br/>Plot the elliptical orbit of Jupiter’s third moon<br/>Name the four ancient capitals of the Mayan empire.<br/>Rufus gets both of these correct.<br/><br/><img src="images/naked_genius/273.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim closes the door and follows Ron as he walks away.<br/><br/>FADE TO BLACK -- END CREDITS<br/><br/>Final thoughts: It has been debated on whether Ron is good at math, or if he is just plain lazy.  In the Season 3 episode Bad Boy, Ron is seen doing complex physic calculations while doing highly technical mechanical structures.  This seems to conclude that Ron is actually good at math, but doesn’t like to do it.  Ron most likely gained this ability genetically from his father, whose number crunching genius earned him actuary of the year.<br/><br/>
