Show notes: Kim switches bodies with Ron, and sees how unpopular he is.  This will lead to Kim changing Ron in the near future into a capable sidekick.  This movie was loosely inspired by the Disney movie Freaky Friday.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>MHS sign<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The cheerleaders practice their routine.  An unknown mystery cheerleader is standing behind Hope on the far bottom right.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim bumps into Tara during the routine.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>All the cheerleaders go down.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie complains about Kim’s failed routine, and calls it fussy.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is confident her routine will win the regionals.  She also indicates the regionals are tomorrow.  The MHS sign indicates the cheer finals are on Friday, which would make this episode occur on a Thursday and a Friday.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim starts the routine again, despite being interrupted by Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron interrupts Kim by spelling her name with a megaphone.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim drags Ron to the side to find out what is so important.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shows Kim the kimmunicator and indicates that Drakken needs her help.<br/><br>
<img src="images/mind_games/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken’s voice is different so that it doesn’t confuse the viewer.  The man with Drakken’s body indicates his name is Cleotis Dobbs, and that he works for the U.S. Army.  Dobbs also speaks with a Southern accent.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thinks that it is actually Drakken’s evil twin on the kimmunicator.  Kim reminds Ron that Drakken is already evil.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dobbs indicates that Drakken used a big machine to switch bodies with him.  He also calls Shego, “The pretty girl who hits.”<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The screen goes blank.  This indicates that Shego took out the camera that Dobbs was using to talk to Kim.  <br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade tries unsuccessfully to get the image back.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains about the stress in her life.  Ron reassures her that she can handle it.  Kim disagrees.  This will be the focus point of the later episode Queen Bebe.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron explains why Kim’s life is so peachy.  “You’re smart, athletic, pretty, and popular.”  Kim fails to realize Ron just gave her a compliment.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim runs down why Ron’s life is so peachy.  “Playing video games, watching wrestling, and downing snackage.”  First time the term “snackage” is used.<br/> <br/><img src="images/mind_games/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron throws in taking caring of Rufus, and maintaining his image.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he doesn’t have an image yet, but he’s working on one.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates he couldn’t reestablish contact with Private Dobbs because the frequency is jammed.  This indicates Private Dobbs’ rank in the U.S. Army.  <br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade tried to get a background check, but everything was classified.  Wade indicates he only has a picture of Private Dobbs.  It seems that Wade was able to access part of a security pass card.  The visible numbers at the bottom of the card are 3938258.  <br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken in Private Dobbs’ body has access to what appears to be an underground military facility.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The military facility has both a handprint identification and eye retina scan for security purposes.  This shows why Drakken wanted Private Dobbs’ body.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim runs down some of her workload: Tutoring, the swim team, and the yearbook committee.   <br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Lunch appears to be beef stroganoff.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron jokes about wanting kosher food.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The cafeteria lady is not amused.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron slurps a noodle; much to Kim’s disgust.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls and indicates the call from Private Dobbs came from the Grand Canyon.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron get to this mission by donkey.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The Grand Canyon guide’s name is Baxter.  He is repaying Kim back for helping his donkey named Buttercup.  Kim helped Buttercup have an emergency delivery of a foal in the dark, in the rain, and in a landslide.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s donkey suddenly stalls.  The donkeys don’t have saddles.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is flipped off the donkey.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Baxter suggests trading donkeys.

There is old wood burning stove, an anvil, and shovels hanging from the wall.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thinks Rufus is climbing up his leg.  Rufus appears out of Ron’s shirt pocket.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>In a panic, Ron jumps onto the stove chimney pipe, and kicks out a scorpion that was crawling inside his pant leg.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s weight pulls down the chimney pipe, and reveals a secret elevator.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim calls Ron, “Mr. Dumb Luck.”<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates it’s not dumb luck, it’s dumb skills.  This will later be known as “The Ron Factor.”<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The elevator shaft was built next to dinosaur fossils.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron enjoys the elevator music as it goes down.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The elevator bings when they reach the bottom.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron wonders if they have been in this lair before.  Kim assures him that all lairs start to look the same after awhile.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron deduces that the big machine is for switching brains.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego watches Kim and Ron enter the lair.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The henchmen do too.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim uses the kimmunicator as an x-ray scanner to see what is in the boxes.  Besides Drakken’s body, there is also a rocket, some boxes, and electrical equipment.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim was so intent on rescuing Private Dobbs, she didn’t notice that she was being surrounded.  Private Dobbs warns her.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego stands on top of some boxes with henchmen ready for attack.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego flips off the box.  Before she even lands, she tries to attack Kim.  The two start fighting.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Private Dobbs indicates his mother always told him to be polite to a lady, except when she locks him in a crate.

Her head hits the brain switch machine.  The brain switch cap goes onto her head.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries a martial art move.

The brain switch machine frizzed Kim’s hair.  Things like changing clothes, bathing, or going to the bathroom weren’t covered in this episode.

<img src="images/mind_games/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron complains that he told Kim not to go near the brain switch machine.  Kim corrects him of this, saying he didn’t mention it.

Drakken will have to modify the machine a bit because of this.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is more likely stronger than Kim.  Kim uses Ron’s body to pick up Drakken’s body with one arm and keep running.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim finds it easier to knock down henchmen with Ron’s body, while still maintaining the same amount of agility.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bottom of Ron’s shoe says Made In Hollywood U.S.A.  <br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego leapfrogs from one glass cylander to another to get ahead of Kim, Ron, and Private Dobbs.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, and Private Dobbs are surrounded by Shego and henchmen.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego taunts Kim and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim talks back to Shego, in Ron’s body.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego realizes Kim and Ron switch bodies, and laughs.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron kicks Shego in the shin.

Tim likes this idea.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kimmunicator beeps.  Ron answers it, and tries to fool Wade into thinking that he’s Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade knows who he is talking to.  He calls Ron, “Brain switch boy.”<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabbs the kimmunicator from Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that there was a security breach at Private Dobbs’ post.

A minor mistake.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates that Drakken has moved.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is discouraged that she can’t get her body back.

Drakken uses movers to move his stuff; not his regular henchmen.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A crashing sound is heard.  Drakken complains that the equipment was marked fragile.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken complains about having to move his lair, thanks to Kim.  Shego indicates that there is nothing wrong with a time share.

Or it may be that Shego is crushing on Drakken with Private Dobbs’ body.  In either case, Drakken doesn’t buy it.  He demands to have his own body back.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates he’ll keep a lookout for Drakken.

The best Ron can do is a rolling tumble.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron enjoys wearing Kim’s cheerleading uniform, because the breeze feels good.  Kim’s cheerleading shorts can be seen in this shot.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim changes the subject by suggesting lunchage.

Kim denies that being unpopular is any different.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie and Jessica grab Ron and drag him away for the cheer regionals.  Tara says, “East Side is so history!”  This might indicate who Middleton’s biggest rival is.

Make him supreme ruler of earth, or he will use the neutronilizer every hour on a major city.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Shego asks what the neutronilizer does.

Kim is willing to give it a chance.<br/><br/><img src="images/mind_games/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kimmunicator has a cord on the side that plugs in to act as a power source.
