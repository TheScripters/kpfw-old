Show notes: This episode introduces Gill, and expands Ron’s childhood trauma from Camp Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The episode starts out on a bus with the MHS cheerleaders annoying Mr. Barkin with their cheer.  Hope and Crystal seem to be missing from this scene.  In actuality, Hope is sitting beside Bonnie.  Crystal is sitting beside Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin demands they save some of their spirit for a cheer competition they are on their way to.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron annoys everyone by putting on his Mad Dog mask.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus shares Ron’s excitement.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that Ron is on thin ice with the other cheerleaders.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/5.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thinks everyone is bossy around him.  Kim indicates she isn’t bossy.  Ron indicates that Kim is bossy towards him.  Rufus agrees.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn’t admit to being bossy.  But she does admit to usually knowing what’s best.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is deterred from the subject when he notices the landscape looks familiar.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron grabs the kimmunicator from Kim and demands from Wade to have a GPS lock on their position.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls Ron, “Mad dog,” and tells him to calm down.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The map on the kimmunicator shows them near Camp Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron begins flipping out.  Rufus hides in Ron’s pocket.  It’s been theorized on the message boards that Ron was perfectly okay and maybe even above normal standards when the events of Camp Wannaweep turned Ron into what he is today.  Many also theorize that all of Ron’s potential was forever damaged by Camp Wannaweep as well.<br/><br/>
<img src="images/sink_or_swim/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron demands Mr. Barkin drive fast to avoid Camp Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that the summer at Camp Wannaweep the worst ever.  He swore he would never come back here.  Kim seems annoyed by Ron.  She obviously has heard of the horror stories involving Camp Wannaweep, but has most likely never been there herself.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The tires on the bus are flattened by planks of wood with nails driven through them.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The school bus nearly runs off the road.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is determined not to allow the bus to wipe out.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bus comes to a peaceful stop.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin demands to know that everyone is okay.  Ron indicates that he is not.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Camp Wannaweep sign.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin finds the bus has two flats.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie demands all the cheerleaders use their cell phones and try to call for help.  Then they find there’s no service.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie throws her phone in frustration.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim finds it unusual the kimmunicator isn’t working either.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin asks Ron if he knows his way around Camp Wannaweep.  Ron indicates he does.  Mr. Barkin asks Ron where the phone is.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin’s question sends Ron into a flashback to when he called his mother every three minutes from a payphone to demand that they get him from summer camp.  First time we see Ron as a preteen.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin demands Ron lead the way to the pay phone.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is reluctant at first.  Then he realizes that he can be a hero. <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron annoys Kim by indicating that he is their only hope.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron announces how dangerous and wicked Camp Wannaweep is, and that he is the only one who can help them survive.  This falls back onto the idea that Ron is desperate to help a damsel in distress.  In this case, it is the MHS cheerleaders.  Ron worries Tara, annoys Kim, frustrates Bonnie, and the others aren’t sure what to think.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron proves how resourceful he is by knowing what a poison oak plant looks like.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has a flashback to when he picked up some poison oak in curiosity and had severe itching afterwards.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time Ron calls Camp Wannaweep, “A place of evil.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It’s unknown where Ron got the flashlight.  The bus most likely had one in an emergency kit.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First real appearance of Cabin 13.  It was only seen in flashbacks from previous episodes.  Ron’s old cabin <br/>is on the outskirts from the rest of the camp.  Thirteen is considered to be bad luck.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A shooting star passes overhead.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Liz and Marcella are missing from this scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates the pay phone is out of order.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara begins worrying that the situation is just like a horror movie where teenagers are killed by a psychopath.  This episode is a parody of those horror movies like Friday The 13th.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries to look creepy with the flashlight.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie affirms that if it was a horror movie, there would be more guys, and they would be cuter than Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that the cruel kids at summer camp used to call him names, while throwing sticks and stones at him.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time we hear Crystal talk.  She indicates she saw something move.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs the flashlight from Ron and shines it on a squirrel.  First squirrel to be seen in the series.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has another flashback to more vicious squirrels during his stay at Camp Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin makes fun of Ron for always being wimpy.  Ron indicates the squirrels were bigger then.  Mr. Barkin then asks if the squirrels were bigger because Ron was just smaller.  Ron is certain the squirrels were just bigger.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that they are stuck for the night.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus reminds Ron that he’s in charge.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells the horror stories revolving around his childhood at Camp Wannaweep.  It involves how he was trapped hiding in a hollow of tree, and woodpeckers.  Ron doesn’t finish this story.  It’s unclear who started the campfire or how.  It was most likely either Mr. Barkin or Kim.  Liz is missing from this scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie complains about how freaked Ron is.  Kim doesn’t agree at first, then realizes Ron really is acting freaky.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron says, “It’s the curse of Camp Wannaweep!”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara begins wondering if Camp Wannaweep really is cursed.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin indicates that Ron is really working on his nerves.  Ron quiets him because he hears something from the brush.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron approaches the brush.  Kim comes to him believing that the rustling is from the squirrels.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim puts her arm around Ron’s and leads him back to the campfire.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A strange creature with red eyes peers through the brush.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/sink_or_swim/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The sounds of nature, including an owl and a howling wolf also freak Ron out.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Everybody has changed seating positions around the campfire.  Tara is now sitting close to Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara begins talking to Ron about the experiences he had at Camp Wannaweep.  In this case, it’s how Ron shared the cabin with Bobo the chimp.  This was originally revealed in Monkey Fist Strikes.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron confesses to having all bad experiences at Camp Wannaweep.  Not one experience was good.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she is going to get some firewood.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron demands Kim use “the buddy system” and have someone come along with her.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she can handle it on her own.  Then Mr. Barkin volunteers to join her.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Mr. Barkin both confess to wanting to get away from Ron’s camp stories.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Mr. Barkin are followed by the creature with red eyes.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara indicates she thinks that Camp Wannaweep is nice.  Tara might have been hinting about how romantic the woods are with a peaceful fire going.  Of course, Ron doesn’t pick up Tara’s hints that she is crushing on him.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara’s talk about how nice Camp Wannaweep is angers Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie seems annoyed by Tara.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara then comments about how peaceful Lake Wannaweep is.  Ron affirms how much he hates Lake Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Marcella, Jessica, and Crystal all slump as they realize they’re about to hear another camp story.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron flashbacks to his days as a camper at Camp Wannaweep.  Ron refused to go swimming because the water was too fowl.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Gil as a preteen.  Gil calls Ron, “squeeb.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron was allowed to take Gil’s place in arts and crafts, while Gil took his afternoon swim.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron was looking forward to arts and crafts.  He intended to have some homemade wallets, potholders, and lanyards.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates that was the last time he ever saw Gil.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie affirms that Ron has been a loser his entire life.  This annoys Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim heard a squishing sound.  Mr. Barkin thinks that Ron’s stories are getting to Kim’s imagination.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The creature grabs Mr. Barkin and drags him into the nearby bushes.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim calls for Mr. Barkin, not knowing what happened to him.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/sink_or_swim/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim returns back to the campfire hoping the others have seen Mr. Barkin.  They have not.  This begins to freak everybody out.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim realizes that Liz and Marcella are missing.  Tara indicates that Liz and Marcella went to find a bathroom.  Tara calls it, “the little girl’s cabin.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Liz and Marcella scream.  Kim takes off running to find them.  Ron tries to keep up reminding Kim to use the buddy system.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron reminds Kim of the importance of the buddy system.  Kim reminds Ron that the buddy system didn’t work for Liz and Marcella.  They’re obviously gone.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus finds an oddly shaped footprint.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Upon seeing what is obviously not a human footprint, Kim confesses to getting freaked out.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron takes everybody to Cabin 13.  Ron indicates that he was able to survive everything Camp Wannaweep threw at him from here.  Jessica is missing from this scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has a flashback to when he was nearly pelted with suction cup arrows by the other campers.  The arrows form a sad face.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Obviously accepting Ron as the role of leader, Tara indicates she is hungry and hopes he can provide food.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron steps on a loose board of the cabin and reveals his old secret stash of food.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gives Tara Pop Pop Porters pork wafers.  This is another indication that despite being Jewish as revealed in a later episode, Ron still enjoys non-kosher foods.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim reminds Tara how old the food is.  It has to be at least four years old.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates there are enough preservatives to make the pork wafers last for decades.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara eats a pork wafer.  She indicates that it’s not too bad; and “definitely food style.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie changes the subject by whining about how they’re going to miss the cheer competition. <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Crystal grabs Bonnie and demands that she forget the competition and concentrate on the situation they’re in.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie agrees at first.  Then she wonders if whatever took Mr. Barkin, Liz, and Marcella could drive them to the competition.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim demands everyone stay calm and puts herself in charge.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron refuses Kim to become the leader.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time Ron says, “Note serious face.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin calls for Kim from outside.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim grabs Ron’s wrist and they head outside.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is running.  And he is covered in goo.  An owl in a tree watches him.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron find Mr. Barkin.  He reveals that “It” was dripping with ooze and muck.  Mr. Barkin can’t even describe it because it makes him ill to think about it.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus gags at the thought of whatever it was.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is certain that she has faced worse opponents.  Then she’s not so sure.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim, Ron, and Mr. Barkin hear the cheerleaders scream at Cabin 13.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Something causes the walls and the door to bend and buckle.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Cabin 13 is suddenly destroyed by a flood of ooze.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The MHS cheerleaders are held by the oozing muck.  Tara, Crystal, and Hope are hanging from the wall.  Bonnie, Jessica, Marcella, and Liz are being held on the bunk beds.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin indicates this creature is the one who he was talking about.  The creature almost resembles the monster from the movie The Creature From The Black Lagoon.  The creature talks directly to Ron and calls him, “Squeeb.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The creature reminds “Ronnie” who he was by indicating that Ron took his arts and crafts while he took Ron’s swim practice.  Ron remembers the creature as Gil.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Having missed the camp story about Gil, Kim and Mr. Barkin question who he is.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gil indicates that his name is now Gill.  He added an L because he now has gills to breath underwater.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill flings oozing muck from his hand and hits Kim.  It nails her to the tree.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill knows who Kim is.  Gill indicates he knows this by learning all he could about Ron.  Gill is angry that Ron is not a mutant like he is.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin tries to take charge and tries to end the disagreement between Ron and Gill.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill sticks Mr. Barkin to a tree with ooze.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill explains that he was mutated because the lake was polluted from runoff from the science camp.  This is also why Camp Wannaweep was shut down.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets science camp and band camp mixed up.  Band camp is next to the science camp.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron then gets band camp and clown camp mixed up.  Clown camp is next to the band camp.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he loves clowns. <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shows off a lanyard that he has.  He most likely made this one recently showing that he still has the talent.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates she knows scientists who might be able to help Gill.  Gill refuses the help.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron makes a bad joke that maybe Gill was mutated by the clowns.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill is about to reveal how he jammed the communications, but Kim reveals it first.  Gill stole equipment from the telecommunications camp.  Kim then reveals that Gill was behind everything that has happened at Camp Wannaweep tonight.<br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill indicates that he did everything so he could have revenge against Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is both terrified and excited that somebody went through the trouble to take revenge against him.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill indicates that prolonged exposure to the oozing muck will turn someone into a mutant like he is.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie is still thinking about the cheer competition.  Tara is no longer being held on the wall by the oozing muck.  An unknown cheerleader is now present on the wall instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill indicates that there is no cheer competition.  It was all a trap.  And he is now ready for revenge.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill leaves a footprint of oozing muck whenever he takes a step.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Instead of revenge, Ron suggests the Camp Wannaweep friendship song.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Instead of using his hand to fling the oozing muck, Gill spits it out by burping to hit Ron.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron dodges the muck.  Kim is hit instead.  It doesn’t hurt her though.  It’s just disgusting.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron runs and slides in between Gill’s legs to escape.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron opens a hatch and indicates that it is an escape tunnel.  We don’t know if Ron made the escape tunnel himself, or if it was there before.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie and Tara complain that Ron is ditching them.  Kim tries to defend Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is distracted by Mr. Barkin mutating.  First time Mr. Barkin says, “Cheese and crackers!”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron’s escape tunnel leads to the arts and crafts cabin.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A bear skin covers Ron’s escape tunnel.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The escape tunnel doesn’t have a door or latch.  The bear skin may have been put down to cover this secret entrance.  Or it was considered unsightly and the bear skin was to cover this up.  In either case, it is a bit hazardous.  Someone could fall through and get hurt.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets prepared.  In this case, it looks like he is taking rolls of tape.  But it is actually rope.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Rufus hear a sound.  Gill bursts through the floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill attacks by spitting muck.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The muck is strong enough to penetrate and destroy the arts and crafts cabin.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill destroys clay pots on the wall.  The arts and crafts cabin also most likely did pottery as well.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The muck can’t penetrate or damage the bear skin Ron is hiding under.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill stops attacking because he is out of breath.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill pulls the bear skin away.  Instead of Ron, a totem pole is there.  Ron climbed out the window.  Gill decides not to pursue Ron.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is now at the boat house.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron makes a lanyard and uses the line, “Mr. Rabbit comes out of his hole and hops around the tree---” to help him.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is working on the motorboat.  He throws down a bolt, a spark plug, a screw, and another spark plug.  <br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus is covered in grease.  He finds a spark plug and puts it into the boat by twisting it in without any tools.  We don’t know what was wrong with the other two spark plugs that Rufus threw away.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron moves the boat into the water.  He is also wearing a life preserver and water wings<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/153.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron has trouble getting the engine going.  First time he uses the phrase, “This does not bode well.”<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/154.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus kicks the engine and gets it going.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/155.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill tries convincing the cheerleaders that Ron ditched them.  Kim doesn’t believe it.  After hearing a motor boat on the lake going by, Kim isn’t so sure.  The other cheerleaders are convinced that Ron ditched them.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/156.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill is angry that Ron is out on what he considers to be his lake.  Gill’s eyes go from red to pink, depending on the light.  In this case, they are both.  Jessica is now hanging from the wall.  <br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/157.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin has trouble breathing.  He panics as he realizes he is getting gills.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill swims to catch up to Ron.  He hops out of the water the same way a fish does to get food.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill swims downward.  He swims like a normal human, but he is much faster.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill can most likely see perfectly underwater.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The boat slows to a stop.  Ron complains to Rufus about not making sure the engine had enough gas.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill shows up at the front of the boat.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>This picture slashing is done often in Japan’s animation.  This shows the expressions of two people at two different areas at the same exact time.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron jumps into the water.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes up for air.  He complains about how funky the water is.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill shows up near Ron.  He affirms that Ron can’t win because he can’t move around in the water as good as he can.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill attacks Ron and takes him underwater.  Ron gets away by kicking him in the stomach.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A rope goes around Gill’s ankle.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron pulls on the rope tightening the loop.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>At Ron’s command, Rufus kicks the motor boat into life.  It wasn’t out of gas after all.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus slides down the rope, bounces off of Gill, then jumps into the water.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The unmanned and out of control boat drags Gill behind it.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The boat runs into a buoy, then veers left.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill runs into the buoy next.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The boat heads for the boathouse.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The boat hits the wharf, the jumps onto the roof.  It crashes and stops.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill is out of breath and doesn’t want to move.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron stands over Gill and gloats.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The police are now at Camp Wannaweep; as well as a bio-harzard team.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill struggles to get out of the net, but can’t get free.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he made the net himself by using his knowledge of lanyards.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/180.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Two men in hazard suits spray chemicals on Mr. Barkin to get the muck off of him.  Mr. Barkin demands they hurry, because he can feel his feet turning into webs.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill is no longer in a net.  He is in a safety harness.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>He is then dropped into a fishbowl.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/183.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has her hands on Ron’s shoulders.  She introduces Dr. Lurkin to Ron, and indicates he specializes in genetic mutations.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/184.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Dr. Lurkin shake hands.  Ron hopes Dr. Lurkin can reverse Gill’s mutation.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/185.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Dr. Lurkin indicates that he specializes in genetically mutated rutabagas.  But he is looking forward to the challenge.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Gill affirms that he will have his revenge.  Gill can talk perfectly normal underwater.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hopes that Gill will be someday be normal again.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin is normal again.  He asks Dr. Lurkin to check his neck to make sure he doesn’t have any gills.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/189.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Officer Hobble congratulates Kim on her work.  Kim indicates that it was actually Ron who did it.  Officer Hobble has trouble believing it at first.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/190.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin pats Ron on the back.  It nearly knocks him forward.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/191.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is surrounded in admiration from the cheerleaders.  Jessica blows him a kiss.  Hope and Crystal are missing from this scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara gives Ron a kiss on the cheek.  This is most likely the first kiss Ron has ever received.  First real indication that Tara was crushing on Ron.  Unfortunately, Ron doesn’t pick up any of her signals, much like his relationship with Kim.  It is revealed much later in Season 3 just how much Tara was crushing on Ron.  By then, it was too late.  It’s even been theorized that Kim might have sabotaged Tara’s chances with Ron, so she could have him to herself.  This is unproven though.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It’s difficult for her, but Bonnie thanks Ron in her own way.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time Rufus growls at anybody.  In this case, it’s Bonnie.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Barkin indicates the police are going to give them a ride.  He demands they get ready to leave.  The bus must have been towed later.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he wants one more minute before leaving.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron checks out a broken down cabin.  It is not Cabin 13.  Cabin 13 did not have steps on the front.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim congratulates Ron and tells him he was awesome.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron affirms that he knows what it takes to win against Camp Wannaweep.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A step breaks.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/200.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that it wasn’t Camp Wannaweep that made Ron resourceful and brave.  He already has those qualities.  Kim helps Ron to his feet.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/201.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Many believe that Kim was crushing on Ron big time in this scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/202.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron hopes that in the next mission, he can be in charge.<br/><br/><img src="images/sink_or_swim/203.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron walk away arguing that the chance of him being in charge is not likely.  This discourages Ron.  It’s been analyzed that Kim has trouble with someone being better than her at something.  This is especially true when Ron is involved.<br/><br/>
