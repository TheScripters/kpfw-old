Show notes: Viewing this episode right after Royal Pain, we see the Kim/Ron relationship on edge.  This episode introduces Ron as the mad dog mascot.  It also gives some background on Mr. Possible and Drakken.  Shego is missing from this episode.  Steve Loter said that Shego was at a wedding.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/1.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The episode starts out with Ron coming out of a school office and sad.  The reason is quickly revealed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/2.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is so depressed, he doesn't even want Bueno Nacho food.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/3.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron's problem is revealed.  He needs an extracurricular activity because it will look good on his college applications.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/4.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim suggests the mathletes, and the debate team.  Ron isn't enthusiastic about either one.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/6.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/7.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells Ron that after school activities are great, like cheerleading for her.  This gives Ron the idea to become a cheerleader.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/8.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron gets his appetite back, only to discover Rufus in his burrito.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/9.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim doesn't like the idea of Ron as a cheerleader.  Mrs. Possible thinks that the idea is cute.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/10.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells her mom that boy bands and brown bear back packs are cute.  Ron as a cheerleader is not cute.  We will find out more about Kim and boy bands in a later episode.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/11.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible wonders if Ron will wear a different cheerleading outfit.  Kim isn't sure.  This is later referenced in October 31st, when in the Halloween flashback to their childhood, Ron dressed as a ballerina.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/12.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time we see the space propulsion lab.  Mrs. Possible calls and asks what kind of pizza Mr. Possible would like.  First indication that Mr. Possible likes bacon on his pizza.  He also leans back on the console and launches the test rocket.  This is an indication that Mr. Possible is a little bit absent minded like Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/13.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible says, ''See you in thirty minutes or less.''  This indicates that the Possible home is not far away from the space propulsion lab.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/14.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Bob Chen.  Indication that Bob Chen is an astronomer.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/15.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the bebes.  Bebes have red eyes in the dark.  This is a reference to movie The Terminator.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/16.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates the rocket that just went up was the prototype  G-6.  It wasn't supposed to be launched until next week.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/17.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bob figures that Mr. Possible leaned on the button ''again.''  This indicates that Mr. Possible has accidentally shot off a rocket more than once.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/18.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bob asks Mr. Possible if he is going to class reunion this weekend..  Meanwhile, the bebes scan him.  This is another reference to The Terminator.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/19.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The military has scrambled around Mr. Possible's rocket.  They do this to shoot it down if the rocket is armed for mass destruction.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/20.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Tara is missing from this scene.  The cheerleaders are upset about Ron wanting to join their group.  It seems they have elected Bonnie as their spokesperson.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/21.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim expresses her displeasure in Ron wanting to join the cheer squad.  But they have to allow Ron to try out.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/22.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie calls Ron a ''loser.''  First time Bonnie calls Ron a loser.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/23.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim defends Ron, saying that he is not a loser.  ''He's just different.''  But Kim has to think about this statement.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/24.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes in with his eyes covered.  First time Ron covers his eyes so he doesn't see ladies undressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/25.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The cheerleaders are not happy with Ron's presence.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/26.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie, Liz, and Crystal slam the door on Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/27.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>They slam the door so hard, Ron goes flying backwards.  He lands in a pile of pom poms.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/28.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Not knowing they're spending extra time talking about him, Ron thinks the cheerleaders are taking extra time getting dressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/29.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks where the other cheerleaders are.  Kim confirms they take a long time to get dressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/30.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/31.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks Ron if he really wants to be a cheerleader.  Ron tells her no.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/32.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is elated with this answer.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/33.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron isn't going to be a cheerleader, because he wants to be the mascot.  First appearance of the Middleton mad dog.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/34.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates he made the mask from his movie make up magic kit.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/35.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron made a Kim mask.  Rufus is inside and asks, ''What's the sitch?''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/36.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is impressed, and slightly disturbed.  The other mask is from Disney's Beauty And The Beast.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/37.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron demonstrates the mad dog foam, which comes out when Ron squeezes a hand pump.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/38.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron sprays Kim and Bonnie with mad dog foam.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/39.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron indicates the mad dog foam is actually banana cream.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/40.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus jumps on Bonnie and licks the cream off her arm.  She grabs Rufus by the tail and pulls him off of her.  Indication that Bonnie is not afraid of Rufus.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/41.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Bonnie thinks the entire school will laugh at Ron.  ''Loudly and cruelly.''  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/42.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron thinks that Kim will support him.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/43.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Unfortunately, Kim agrees with Bonnie.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/44.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron picks up his mad dog mask and walks off.  He leaves everything else behind.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/45.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim wonders how this will effect Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/46.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim sits on a floor cushion.  The ads on the back suggests that she is reading a magazine.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/47.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim asks her father about a problem.  Mr. Possible passes off the boy problems onto Mrs. Possible.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/48.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim says that it's not a boy problem.  It's about Ron.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/49.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible can handle a Ron problem.  First indication that Mr. Possible doesn't consider Ron an average boy.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/50.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible uses the street term ''posse'' to describe his old college friends.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/51.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible in his younger days in the 1980's.  Computers had oversized green screen monitors back then.  The computer is using basic programming, which meant you had to input all commands in the computer before it did anything.  Gary Cole almost got the role of Sonny Crocket in Miami Vice before it was given to Don Johnson.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/52.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The flashback occurs on the night of the big science department mixer.  Mr. Possible indicates that in those days, he wasn't much of a ladies man.  This flashback occurs before Mr. and Mrs. Possible were married or even dating.  Kim Possible premiered in 2001.  If Kim is sixteen years old in 2001, then this flashback occurs before 1985.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/53.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Ramesh.  Possible and his friends are waiting on somebody named Drew.  He was supposed to be there half an hour ago.  He was also supposed to bring dates.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/54.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drew Lipski in his younger days, before he went evil.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/55.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drew didn't bring girls.  He brought robotic females who call themselves, ''Bebe.''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/56.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Possible, Chen, and Ramesh are not impressed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/57.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After a quick dance, Drew proposes the idea that his bebes are ''gentle as a spring shower.''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/58.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drew's posse disagree.  The idea of robots as a substitute for real women make Possible, Chen, and Ramesh laugh.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/59.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Getting laughed at by his closest college friends is what makes Drew decide to make the world pay for taunting him.  Drew promises one day his bebes will be perfect.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/60.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drew can't build a good robot.  The head springs off.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/61.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates Drew dropped out of college and they never saw him again.  Mr. Possible shows regret for laughing at Drew.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/62.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates they laughed for days because of Drew and his robot bebes.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/63.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite her father's request, Kim refuses to rethink about Ron's dream of becoming the mad dog mascot.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/64.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Kim feud over how stupid the mad dog routine is.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/65.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron puts on the Kim mask and makes fun of her.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/66.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade calls.  They got a hit from a Professor Ramesh from the Mount Middleton Observatory.   Ramesh's partner, Professor Chen is missing.  Ramesh's first name is never given.  Kim remembers Ramesh from her father's story.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/67.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim says, ''I'll bring the man of a thousand faces.''  This is a reference to Hollywood actor Lon Chaney, who became famous in early silent filmmaking due to his make up and masks effects.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/68.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron refuses a ride with Kim.  He plans to get to the mission his own way.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/69.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim gets to this mission by helicopter.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/70.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Dallas, the helicopter pilot.  Dallas does The Eye Over Middleton, and reports on traffic.  He is repaying Kim after she stopped a high speed police pursuit.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/71.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron with a bicycle helmet on.  Ron gets to this mission by bicycle.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/72.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron hiss to fake bad reception.  We don't know how Kim is communicating with Ron.  Ron doesn't have his own kimmunicator.  He could be using a walkie-talkie, or a cell phone.  Ron has a cell phone in a later episode.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/73.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First clear appearance of the bebes.  First indication that the 
bebes operate from a central hive mind.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/74.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>We later find out the bebes can move faster than time.  They go blurry when doing so.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/182.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After surrounding Professor Ramesh, all three robots announce their names are Bebe.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/75.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes scan Kim and conclude the threat is minimal.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/76.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes seems to know all of Kim's attack styles.  One of the bebes catches and Kim and throws her across the room.  This also indicates the bebes have super strength.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/77.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time the bebes use the phrase, ''Bebe is perfect.''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/78.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes have arms that can elongate themselves and even bend a little.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/181.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim rescues Professor Ramesh by hitting him with an office chair and rolling out of harms way.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/79.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Being robots, the bebes can turn their heads completely around.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/183.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes can also walk on the walls.  They block the exit and surround Kim and Professor Ramesh.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron shows up, ringing the bell on the bicycle.  He's exhausted from peddling uphill all the way.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/81.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes can elongate their necks as well.  Ron sees a bebe and passes out.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/82.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes capture Professor Ramesh.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/83.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim blames Ron for Professor Ramesh's capture.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/84.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron accidentally steps on a picture of Possible, Chen, and Ramesh from their college days.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/85.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Rufus figured out that Mr. Possible was going to be kidnapped next by the bebes.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/86.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron didn't get what Rufus was telling him.  Instead, he complained of Mr. Possible's 1980's fashion sense.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/87.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>After figuring out that Mr. Possible is the next target, Ron squishes Rufus between himself and the picture.  Ron decides that he doesn't need Kim, and goes off alone.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/88.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron leaves, ringing the bicycle bell again and taking the photo with him.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/89.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of Mr. Possible's car.  It has a car alarm.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/184.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible's car is loosely based on the Jaguar.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/90.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes capture Mr. Possible.<br/><br/>

<img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/91.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible opens the gym door during cheerleading practice and shouts Kim's full name in anger.  It's Kimberly Anne Possible.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/92.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible demands to know where Ron is.  Kim tells him that Ron isn't with her.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/93.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>All the cheerleaders except Marcella are annoyed by the distraction.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/94.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible complains about the hole in the roof of his car.  Kim wonders what he is talking about.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/95.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible explains that Ron came over and said something about a mission.  Again, Kim doesn't know what he is talking about.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/96.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes stand guard over Professor Chen, Professor Ramesh, and Mr. Possible.  They are not in a cage.  It appears to be a high electrical energy field.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/97.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Professor Chen thinks that they have been kidnapped for a plot to take over the world.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/98.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Both Professor Chen and Professor Ramesh recognize that Drew Lipski is actually Dr. Drakken.  Since he dropped out of college, Drakken is not a real doctor of anything.  The title was given to him by himself.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/99.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron in dress clothes and a tie.  Ron pulls off a Mr. Possible revealing that he is the one who was actually kidnapped; not Mr. Possible.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/100.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken recognizes Ron and thinks that Kim is near.  Ron indicates that Kim didn't know his plan.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/101.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First view of Middleton's quiet neighborhood.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/102.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim contacts Wade who is eating a taco.  Perhaps he went to Bueno Nacho.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/103.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim guesses that Wade has Ron micro-chipped.  Wade indicates he does.  When asked about this, Steve Loter said that it was like a mosquito bite, indicating the chip is just underneath Ron's skin.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/104.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim complains about how slow her father is driving.  Mr. Possible indicates they are in a school zone.  This wouldn't have mattered at night.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/105.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken scolds his bebes.  He indicates he programmed them with a little bit of human emotion so they would be ashamed of failures.  If the bebes had scanned Ron thoroughly, they would not have mistaken him for Mr. Possible.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Programmed with human emotion, the bebes get annoyed and threatening after Drakken calls them, ''Lackeys.''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron asks why Drakken was after Kim's father.  Drakken never realized that Mr. Possible was any relation to his arch foe.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron and Drakken argue about how popular the last name ''Possible'' is.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken leaves to prove the popularity of the last name Possible, by finding a phone book.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/110.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Middleton Mountain Lodge.  This is not the same building as in Downhill.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/111.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The mountain lodge has a valet service.  But the valet is asleep.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/112.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates that the valet is asleep because of knock out gas.  We don't know if Kim can detect knock out gas by sight or smell, or if the kimmunicator told her.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/113.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Everyone in the lobby is asleep too.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/114.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible hopes they get it cleared up before the college reunion on the weekend.  This indicates the college reunion was to occur at the motor lodge.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/115.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Mr. Possible have barely passed when Drakken pops up from behind the motor lodge counter after getting the phone book.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim turns the lights on.  For some reason, Drakken has them turned off.  The lodge room is set and ready for the college reunion.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tells Kim that Drakken is behind the plot to kidnap Chen, Ramesh, and her father.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken comes in past Kim and Mr. Possible.  He has the Middleton phone book.  He indicates there is only one Possible family living in Middleton.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First time the phrase, ''Doi!'' is used.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken is so surprised, he forgets that Mr. Possible is Kim's father until Ron reminds him.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible and Kim both suddenly realize that Drakken is Mr. Possible's old college buddy, Drew Lipski.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible indicates that he didn't recognize Drew Lipski as Drakken because he now has blue skin.  Mr. Possible may also have been thrown off by the scar.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken indicates that he promised revenge after being scorned by his closest friends, ''his posse.''<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken chose the reunion to extract his revenge, after getting an invitation.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/125.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible takes the invitation from Drakken.  Mr. Possible reminds Drakken that he dropped out and didn't graduate, and therefore is not entitled to the college reunion.  This indicates that Drakken dropped out of college sometime (perhaps middle to late) in his senior year.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/126.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken commands the bebes to return to him at once.  The bebes come back in just a couple of seconds.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/127.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken concludes that these bebes are perfect, and that they obey his every command.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/128.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes ask themselves if they are perfect, then why do they take orders from somebody not perfect.

She is wearing matching shorts underneath her cheerleading skirt.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim smacks the bebes together.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Professor Ramesh asks Mr. Possible where Kim learned ''to kick bottom.''  Mr. Possible answers cheerleading.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim forgot about the third bebe, and jumps right into it's arms.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is thrown across the room.  She slides on the floor most of the way.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is more frustrated than she is hurt.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>A bebe picks up a nearby table and throws it at Kim.  Kim dodges it in time.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The other two bebes get unstuck.  All three bebes prepare to attack Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/142.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim prepares to counterattack with the stage microphone.  She displays her twirling skill before doing so.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/143.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebe blocks the attack, breaking the microphone pole in half.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/144.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes surround Kim and capture her.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/145.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron tries his diplomatic skills to get everyone to work together to help Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Professor Chen and Professor Ramesh remind Ron that they're both astronomers, and really can't do anything.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron even tries to get Drakken's help, who refuses to do so; even though Kim just saved his life.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible takes action by contacting Wade and asking for a sonic disturbance.  He demands the sonic disturbance be loud and ultra high frequency.   Wade understands it is for jamming a wireless network signal.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/149.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible says, ''Please and thank you.''  This indicates where Kim got her catch phrase from.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/150.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The sonic disturbance is so loud, everyone has to hold their ears and block it out.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/151.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kimmunicator runs a television test pattern during the sonic disturbance.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/152.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes begin malfunctioning.  They analyze Mr. Possible and conclude the threat is substantial.

He about to smash it with his foot when Kim makes and dive and rescues it.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The floor must be made of smooth, slick tile.  This is the second time Kim slides across the floor.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The bebes continue malfunctioning and indicate they've lost the hive mind connection.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible reminds Kim that he doesn't like violence, but the bebes are deadly robots, so it is okay to destroy them.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/162.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim dodges the attack of the bebe in the middle, causing it to destroy the other two.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/163.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim kicks the bebe on the far left into the other two, and they all explode into different pieces.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/164.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible is almost hit with bebe debris.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/165.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken tries to sneak off unnoticed.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/166.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible forgot that the kimmunicator is still broadcasting the signal disturbance.  Another indication that Mr. Possible is a bit absent minded like Ron.  Kim turns off the kimmunicator.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/167.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken stumbles over a bebe part lying on the ground while trying to escape.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/168.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim cuts Drakken off before he can get away.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/169.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/170.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Drakken pushes a button on his belt and two rockets and shoulder straps appear.

He hits the ceiling and gets stuck.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mrs. Possible brings in a pizza for Mr. Possible, Professor Ramesh, and Professor Chen.  The pizza is pepperoni, even though Mr. Possible likes bacon.  Mrs. Possible indicates that she remembers Drew, but also didn't recognize him as Drakken.  Also, since Mr. and Mrs. Possible were not dating when Drew left college, Mrs. Possible most likely didn't know him very well.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible explains how he defeated the bebes:  The hive behavior was clearly the result of cybertonic linkage through a wireless control network.  <br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>As astronomers, Chen and Ramesh have no idea was Mr. Possible is talking about.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim listens to her father reiterate about how if they hadn't laughed at Drew, would there be another mad scientist in the world?<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim allows Ron to try out the mad dog routine.  Mostly it due to their friendship, but partly Kim is afraid of Ron turning into a mask wearing super villain.  This puts the events of Crush and Royal Pain behind Kim and Ron and they move on as friends again, but with less shippiness.<br/><br/><img src="images/attack_killer_bebes/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First basketball game seen at the Middleton gym.

This helps Ron stay on the cheer squad.<br/><br/>
