Kim tells Tim that he can’t use his hands because he’s not a goalie.  Tim indicates that Caitlin is the goalie.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/80.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim kicks Tim’s ball out of his hand with her knee.

Junior takes back the blueprints, and assures his father it will be the greatest achievement of his life.

Wade calls Senior, “Triple S.”<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/106.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Everyone cheers when Kim tells them she has to leave.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/107.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim tells the kids to keep practicing till she gets back.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/108.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior struck at a place called  Neon Incorporated.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/109.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the Neon Inc. scientist.

Junior indicates it is his video calling card, and it will be his villainous trade mark.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/116.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior grabs Junior by ear and drags him away.  The video camera fell still recording.  A door in the Senior’s home is in the background.  Junior recorded the video at home, instead of recording it at the crime scene.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/117.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>In the background, Ron is heard yelling, “My eyes!”  This indicates he was temporaily blinded by the neon demonstration.  Kim and the scientist don’t seem to have much concern though.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/118.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Mr. Possible asks “How’s it going, Kimmy?”  Kim indicates she’s dealing with the usual villain stuff.  Mr. Possible then indicates he was talking about the soccer practice.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/119.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim realizes she forgot about the kids at practice.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/120.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>It is really late in the evening.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/121.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim arrives to find the kids so exhausted they can hardly walk.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/122.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is embarrassed at herself for forgetting the kids at practice.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/123.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Despite being so late, Kim took the time to change into her soccer uniform.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/124.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The kids pass out from being tired.

Kim disagrees, because the other teams won’t be expecting it.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/129.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron comes up with a new theory at Bueno Nacho.  He indicates if you buy one chimerito, you still get a dozen packs of Diablo sauce.  Therefore, there should be a landfill somewhere with nothing but Diablo sauce.  Ron then indicates someday he will find that landfill.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/236.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Meanwhile, Rufus opens a pack of Diablo sauce for his chimerito with his teeth.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/130.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim has a theory of her own.  If she puts on a uniform, she can pass as a tall ten year old.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/131.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim bounces the ball off her head.

Ron catches the ball.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/132.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron complains about Kim’s competitive “Kimness.”  This is one of the few times that Ron is irritated that Kim feels the need to excell all the time and be the best at everything.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/133.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim indicates the team needs an edge and that she’s a hands-on coach.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/134.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron ponders hands-on soccer while Rufus crawls out the bag he jumped into to escape the ball that nearly hit him.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/135.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim.  Before he can say anything, Kim asks him if it is okay to help her team.  Wade asks about fundraising.  Ron indicates Kim wants to play for the team.  Wade disagrees with Kim.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/136.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade streams Junior’s latest video calling card.  Junior says, “Love the nightlife?  Love to boogie?”  This is play on the popular 70’s disco song I Love The Nightlife by Alicia Bridges.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/137.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior has opened a new disco nightclub called Club Lair.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/138.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim notes how much Junior likes being in front of the camera.  Ron notes that Junior looks good in front of the camera.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/139.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior indicates that Club Lair is located in Europe.  This map does not pinpoint exactly where Junior’s club is.  But the precise coordinates may have been included.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/140.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade shakes his head at the thought of Junior telling everyone where he is located.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/141.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior has a cocktail drink.

The animals, now in 70’s style clothes and hair,  start dancing.  The animals may have been inspired by the late sixties/early seventies television show The Banana Splits.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/146.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior asks Junior where the villainy is in his disco.  Junior indicates he just wants to do this on his own.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/147.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron get to this mission in a hot air balloon.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/148.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim is getting a ride from a Mr. Blumberg.

Everyone will party all night long.  Junior will charge extra for the drinks.  Senior doesn’t like this idea of villainy.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/158.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior and Junior are interrupted by Kim and Ron.  Ron is shocked as to what they did to Pizzapotamus and JP Bearymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/159.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior indicates that tonight is the opening night for his club.  He then points out that he did “the eyebrow thing.”<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/160.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron points out that other than dressing Pizzapotamus in polyester, Junior doesn’t seem evil.  Senior agrees.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/161.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior makes a sly remark about Kim and Ron not being on the guest list for his club.

<img src="images/coach_possible/171.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates that the light from the intense neon that was stolen is refracted into a hypnotic pattern by a modified disco ball.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/172.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior doesn’t like the modified disco ball because it makes everyone stand still.  He demands that everyone must dance.  Kim and Ron start dancing the same exact way.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/173.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior indicates that the subject under hypnosis will do the first suggestion they are told to do.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/174.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior thinks Kim and Ron dance well for being hypnotized.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/175.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior takes over Junior’s plan for disco and partying so he can kidnap Europe’s elite.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/176.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior called his disco Club Lair.  All the signs say Jr’s.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/177.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Club Lair has a valet service.  Crowds line up to see the celebrities.  The paparazzi are present too.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/178.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior no longer cares for the opening night of his club.  Senior indicates that he can party all he wants once they control Europe.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/179.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior indicates he doesn’t want to control Europe.

A light above it indicates which button to push.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/186.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>First appearance of the operator.  He appears to be drinking hot coffee.  He answers the phone saying, “Hello.  Europe.”  He is most likely a representative for all European nations.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/187.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The operator asks Senior to speak up because the music is too loud.  Senior asks to be made king in exchange for Europe’s VIPs.  The operator indicates he’ll have someone get back to Senior, and cuts him off.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/188.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade contacts Kim.

This time a claw comes out.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/192.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The claw goes into Kim’s pouch on the side of her belt.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/193.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade controls the claw by using a joystick.  Wade has one finger on the keyboard.  This most likely controls claw gripping onto stuff.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/194.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade brings out sunglasses from Kim’s pouch.<br/><img src="images/coach_possible/195.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade missed putting the sunglasses on Kim because she was dancing.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/196.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Fortunately, Wade caught the sunglasses before they fell.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/197.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade waits an extra second before managing to get the sunglasses on Kim.  She’s no longer hypnotized.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/198.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The dancing cages are not locked.  Kim opens hers by pushing on the door.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/199.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior wants the blackmailing to be done with so he can get back to the party.

He indicates the disco ball wasn’t the only thing that was modified.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/204.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>JP Bearymore’s eyes light up.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/205.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim and Ron move before getting hit by a laser from JP Bearymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/206.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>JP Bearymore pulls the bars of the cage apart and walks forward.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/207.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>JP Bearymore begins shooting eye lasers at Kim and Ron.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/208.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior demands his robot animals to attack.  He most likely modified them to do voice recognition commands.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/209.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>All the robot animals break out of their cages.  <br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/210.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Pizzapotamus fires eye lasers too.

Wade indicates it is the most sophisticated system he’s ever seen.  Kim affirms he should be able to since it is only a banjo playing bear.  Ron complains they took his banjo.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/213.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade indicates he can’t hack into the bear.  He tries to hack the beaver instead.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/214.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Desperate to party, Junior demands everyone start dancing.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/215.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Junior finally begins to enjoy himself.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/216.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Senior angrily demands to know what Junior has done.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/217.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade hacks into the system.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/218.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Wade takes out the beaver and ther otter.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/219.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron is nearly smashed by JP Bearymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/220.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron freezes when he runs into a wall, then turns around to see JP Bearymore.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/221.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim saves Ron by jumping at him and moving him out of the way of the laser.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/222.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim then fires her grappling hook onto a cage.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/223.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Kim swings up and kicks the disco ball onto the floor.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/224.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Before Kim can come down and help, Ron affirms that he can do it.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/225.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>Ron kicks the disco ball.<br/><br/><img src="images/coach_possible/226.jpg" alt="[image] " border="0"/><br/>The disco ball ends up between JP Bearymore and Pizzapotamus as they shoot their lasers.
