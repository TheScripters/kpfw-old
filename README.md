# kpfw-old
Source code for the original KP Fan World site, written in PHP

This Repository is not **actively** maintained, but is left writable for anyone who wants to play around with it.

The `master` branch is locked, but feel free to create a branch. Just let us know your GitHub username to be added or fork it yourself.

A functional copy can be seen here: https://old.kpfanworld.com

Note: This application is ***really*** old and is lacking most modern best practices and was developed against PHP 5.3. It will not run on PHP versions newer than 5.6. There has been no active development on this since roughly 2008/2009.
